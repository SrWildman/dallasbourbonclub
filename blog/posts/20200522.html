					<h1>Top 5/Bottom 5 Bourbon Gifts I've received</h1>
					<p>Inspired by Craig Miller, I wanted to share with you a compilation of some of the great (and not
						so
						great) whiskey
						related gifts that I've received over the years. I present this to you all ahead of Father's Day
						very
						strategically.</p>
				</header>
				<h2>Top Five/Bottom Five - Part 1: Bottom 5 Bourbon Gifts</h2>

				<i>
					<p>Maybe it helps steer your spouse away from these gifts and into something a little more viable.
						This
						week, I'll start
						with the bad and next week, I will present the good. I'll start with the marginally tolerable
						and
						then
						move into the
						really painful stuff. Names have been omitted to protect the innocent.</p>

					<p>Remember, when it comes to bad bourbon gifts: It's the thought that counts. Your spouse, mom,
						dad,
						co-worker tried to
						get you a gift that ties into your hobby. It's thoughtful, it's nice. But sometimes, they just
						need
						to
						give you the cash
						and let you buy what you want.</p>

					<p>My criteria for this Bottom 5 is a combination of:
					<ol>
						<li>How tater-rific is this? (i.e how over the
							top
							and
							ridiculous is
							it?) </li>
						<li>Does it set out to do what it's intended to do? Does it even work?</li>
					</ol>

				<h3>#5 -The Whiskey Wedge</h3>
				<span class="image left"><img src="../images/20200522_b5.png" alt="" /></span>
				This glass exists solely because it looks cool. Some designer like the way the two wedges fit.
				Functionally, it works
				fine. But this one scores high on the tater reader. I've used mine a couple of times and it's fine;
				looks kinda cool,
				the ice works. But you have to freeze the glass in order to get the wedge. Something about holding a
				frozen glass and
				drinking bourbon is a little too much of a call back to my fraternity days.</p>
				<br>

				<h3>#4 - Calumet Bourbon</h3>
				<span class="image right"><img src="../images/20200522_b4.png" alt="" /></span>
				Long ago, a special woman in my life tried to be nice and buy me a good bottle of corn whiskey.
				Unfortunately, she
				probably listened to a Total Wine sales rep and ended up with Calumet Bourbon. She fell into the
				trap of
				buying
				terrible, sourced whiskey. And this stuff is just garbage. Being the snob that I am, I told her how
				I
				felt about this
				one. Needless to say, she has never bought me another bottle of whiskey in six years.</p>
				<br>


				<p>
				<h3>#3 - The Metallic Whiskey Sphere</h3>
				<span class="image left"><img src="../images/20200522_b3.png" alt="" /></span>
				All of those gadgets that aim to cool your whiskey without watering it down were born out of a noble
				pursuit. But in
				reality, they really don't do anything. The Whiskey Sphere is certainly one of those gadgets. It
				doesn't
				do much to cool
				the bourbon, and you look ridiculous with a chunk of metal in your drink.</p>
				<br>


				<p>
				<h3>#2 - Sean Lee Whiskey Stones</h3>
				<span class="image right"><img src="../images/20200522_b2.png" alt="" /></span>
				I'm a diehard Cows fan. I'm a known drinker of bourbon. Combining the two makes sense when it comes
				to
				giving me a gift.
				But whiksey stones? I hope they elicit a groan or an eye roll from you as well. Whiskey stones have
				been
				proven to be
				worthless; they don't work. In fact, they seriously bother me because they are such an obvious grift
				and
				way to con
				whiskey newbies out of their money. While you can say a lot of great things about Sean Lee as a
				player;
				you have to
				admit this is about low as Jerry Jones' love of money and marketing can get. The Cows tater and the
				bourbon tater in me
				just can't seem to swallow this one. This gift has more tater points than anything I own...in fact I
				challenge you to
				top it.</p>
				<br>


				<p>
				<h3>#1 - Paniolo - Hawaiian Cowboy Whiskey</h3>
				<span class="image left"><img src="../images/20200522_b1.png" alt="" /></span>
				Hawaiian. Cowboy. Whiskey. None of that makes any sort of sense logically. It kind of short circuits
				my
				brain just
				typing it out. Hawaii has a lot of things, a history of distilling and cowboys are not some of them.
				But
				how does it
				taste? Well, it taste like brown sugar vodka. It was pretty rough. While I'm thankful a friend gave
				me
				this as a gift,
				I'm not thankful for tasting it. This one takes the crown for the number one worst whiskey I've
				received.</p>
				<br>

				<h2>Top Five/Bottom Five - Part 2: Top 5 Bourbon Gifts</h2>
				<i></p>While American Spirit is clearly the top gift for the bourbon loving Dad in your life,
					I'll go ahead
					and
					finish my
					segment from a few weeks ago. Without further ado, here's the Top 5 Bourbon Gifts I've ever
					received. I
					know there's not
					much time to go out and grab some of these, but I trust you guys...you seem to be able to
					find BTAC
					in
					the Sahara
					Desert..</p></i>

				<h3>#5 Mystery Sample Bombs</h3>
				<span class="image left"><img src="../images/20200522_t5.png" alt="" /></span>
				This is a relatively new development in my bourbon journey, but it's certainly one of my
				favorite. I
				love combining a
				little competition into the bourbon whiskey hobby. These are a major source of entertainment for
				me
				and
				I am always open
				for takers..</p>
				<br>


				<p>
				<h3>#4 Vintage Decanters</h3>
				<span class="image right"><img src="../images/20200522_t4.png" alt="" /></span>
				I love old stuff: old whiskey, old cars, old dogs, Warren Zevon tunes. And old barware is right
				up
				there. For the past
				few years, I've been swinging by estate sales and antique shops in search of old school, leaded
				crystal
				decanters. This
				particular one was a gift for my 30th birthday from my parents, but I just love it's simplicity,
				functionality, and the
				fact that's a beautiful antique</p>
				<br>


				<p>
				<h3>#3 The Whiskey Ice Co Ice Maker</h3>
				<span class="image left"><img src="../images/20200522_t3.png" alt="" /></span>
				Not only is this a damn fine product, it bears a sentimental place in my heart. I won this in a
				sales
				contest when I
				just started out in my current position. It's the culmination of hard work, great design and I
				just
				love
				kicking back on
				Sunday with a great bourbon and winding down the week with this gorgeous machine.</p>
				<br>

				<p>
				<h3>#2 Elsa Peretti Brandy Snifter</h3>
				<span class="image right"><img src="../images/20200522_t2.png" alt="" /></span>
				I have dozens of glencarins, I have a dozen rocks glasses, I have jumbo glasses for cocktails,
				I've
				got
				every vessel for
				drinking whiskey you can imagine. But nothing comes close to these beautiful, artistic glasses
				that
				I
				received for my
				wedding. No other glass improves the nose, the taste, and looks so damn good than these.
				Formerly
				available at
				Tiffany's...</p>
				<br>


				<p>
				<h3>#1 Wild Turkey Diamond</h3>
				<span class="image left"><img src="../images/20200522_t1.png" alt="" /></span>
				A few weeks ago, I mentioned a gift that I got from a very special person in my life and how it
				was
				some
				of the worst
				bourbon I've been gifted. Well, that was when we were dating. When we got married, she stepped
				up
				her
				game and found a
				bottle of Wild Turkey Diamond for me on our first anniversary. Why is this bottle so special?
				There's my
				obvious love of
				Wild Turkey, but, the real reason is that on my wedding day, I drank this with my ushers and my
				groomsmen. It's
				certainly a special bottle in my life...keep a look out for your ol pal Pete!</p>
