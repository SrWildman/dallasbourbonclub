					<h1>Russell's Reserve Private Selection</h1>
					<p>On May 28th, I was joined by a handful of DBC members at Hero's in downtown Dallas, in the
						shadows of the American
						Airlines Center. The agenda was pretty simple: pick a single barrel of Russell's Reserve for the
						Dallas Bourbon
						Club.
						Unafraid of the task at hand, I sat down with Brian Lowe, William Edwards, Chad Nelson, Dustin
						Sheppard, and Wild
						Turkey
						MEGA Fan, Aaron Konen.</p>

				<p>While most Russell's Reserve barrel selections are done at site at Wild Turkey while being guided by
					a member of the
					Russell clan, times are a little funky right now. Given the complications from the Coronavirus and a
					major cutback in
					single barrel allocations for 2020; we were pretty lucky to get on the list for a Russell's Reserve
					pick.</p>

				<p>Our host at Campari was all business. We had five 500 mL bottles lined up: all filled
					with barrel proof
					Russell's Reserve. These uncut samples were from three different rick houses from all over the Wild
					Turkey universe.
					Being the bourbon dorks that we are; we asked that the warehouse locations not be revealed to us so
					that we could focus
					on the whiskey inside the bottle. Because believe me, if I saw a Camp Nelson A selection in front of
					me, I would have
					stopped the selection right there, and chose that one: making it the shortest barrel selection ever.
					But, since
					everything was hidden away from us: we had a job to do. We were bourbon warriors: we had no time for
					hummus or toasted
					almonds; there was uncut Wild Turkey in front of us.</p>

				<p>As previously mentioned, these samples were all straight from the barrel and clocking in around 117
					proof. Additionally,
					unlike a lot of barrel selections: Wild Turkey doesn't like to let you taste it uncut and then again
					at bottle proof.
					No, this is all killer no filler: you are going to make your selection based on the unadulterated
					state. Let me be the
					first to say that Wild Turkey right out of the barrel is nothing short of magical. It's so good, so
					raw, so beautiful.</p>


				<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/20200612_2.png" alt="" /></span>Moving into the samples,
					we got to work one by one. The first sample was a hot little tamale: a very
					hot nose with lots
					of alcohol vapor on it. It was hard to get past the stinging of the alcohol burn and uncover any
					depth on it. The taste
					was not that great either: heavy oak influence. However, the texture was thick and chewy aka
					Beautiful. This was just an
					ok bourbon and looking around the table confirmed my opinion: not the best thing I've ever had.</p>

				<p>The second sample had a really unique nose: licorice and the earthy, savoryness of classic Wild
					Turkey. It kind of
					smells like old potpourri. That savory funkiness was present on the taste as well. This was an oaky
					and smokey corn
					whiskey. The texture was not as good as #1, but it was a really solid whiskey. The group was nodding
					their heads in
					agreement and appreciation.</p>

				<p>For me, the nose on Whiskey #3 was totally on point and it had an outstanding texture. For me, the
					oak presence was a
					loft softer; this was a unique bourbon with soft edges. So far #3 was my leader in the clubhouse.
				</p>

				<p>But then came Whiskies #4 & #5. Whiskey #4 had a delicious maple syrup nose. The taste was nearly
					sublime but it
					materialized back into a bold finished that stuck around awhile. While #4 was outstanding, Whiskey
					#5 was nothing to
					shake a stick at either. It had a nose like a pan of chocolate brownies coming out of the oven. It
					tasted like a brown
					sugar overload and finished with funky spice bomb.</p>


				<p><span class="image right"><img src="../images/20200612_3.png" alt="" /></span>The group was split on
					the pick. There was a ton of great whiskies in the field, except for Whiskey
					#1. So, when we held
					our first vote, it was immediately gone. After polling the team, Barrels #1 and #3 were immediately
					removed. This left
					us with three samples in the second round. We tasted these blind as well so we will now call them
					Whiskies A, B, & C.</p>

				<p>Whiskey A was a classic Wild Turkey: bold and beautiful. However, the texture was thin. But it
					overcame that weak
					viscosity with an outstanding finish of black pepper. The next up was Whiskey B. For me, this was
					not great; it tasted
					grainy and the nose didn't jive with me. Not a fan. And the final selection of the second round was
					Whiskey C. This
					bourbon had a much improved nose, great caramel notes and that quintessential funkiness at the end
					that morphed into a
					long and lingering finish.</p>

				<p>One voice in our group asked us to vote again. Whiskey B was quickly voted out. So the final round
					came down A & C.
					After tasting both, it was put to a vote. That vote was pretty quick and decisive. By a count of six
					votes to one,
					Whiskey C was our selection. Our Campari hosts then revealed this to be Whiskey #4.</p>

				<p>Once our selection was made, it was revealed where each sample came from, along with some tasting
					notes from Eddie..
					According to Eddie, Warehouse B produces whiskey that's "More the typical Wild Turkey: bigger,
					bolder taster." And
					that's where this beauty of a whiskey came from. It also makes a ton of sense: the palates in this
					group are huge Wild
					Turkey fans. So it's not surprising that this group chose a very delicious, very on profile
					Russell's Reserve: we
					selected the best possible version of Wild Turkey that was put in front of us. And I'm damn proud of
					it.</p>

				<p>As always, I'm very excited about another DBC selection. The organization has selected another great
					barrel pick and I'm
					so happy it's Russell's Reserve. This whiskey is fuzz under ten years old and will be bottled at 110
					proof. Expect this
					one closer to the end of the year...until then....I can't wait!</p>
