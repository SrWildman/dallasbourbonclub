					<h1>Recap: Elijah Craig Barrel Selection</h1>
					<p>Back at the end of July, the Dallas Bourbon Club and Lakewood Medallion were approached by Heaven
						Hill with a double
						pack of barrel selections: an Elijiah Craig and a Larceny single barrel. Being the wonderful
						partner that he is; Mark at
						Lakewood turned over both selections to the Dallas Bourbon Club. I was lucky enough to get
						invited to the Elijah Craig
						selection and this is how it all went down.</p>

				<p>
					On a balmy Tuesday afternoon, I met up with Jason Varela, Evan Clark, Michael Belvin, Michael
					Langston
					and Austin
					Rodgers, the owner and proprietor of the new Alamo Club on Greenville. A summer rain had come
					through
					the night before
					and it was cloudy, but sticky out there. This made the Alamo Club's patio a great option...a little
					stickiness in the
					air was no match for the Swamp Cooler.
				</p>

				<p>
					The selection kicked off around 5:15 with some tasty store picks the guys had acquired. Belvin
					brought
					some Mochi donuts
					(first time having one and oh my God) and we had a small chacuterie board for palate cleansing.
					Since we
					were not being
					hosted by a Heaven Hill brand rep, the selection was a little less formal and more member driven.
					Some
					times, it's nice
					not to sign through a marketing schpeel and you can just get down to business with the group. This
					especially rings true
					when it's a well known brand like Elijah Craig, "the Father of Bourbon."

				</p>

				<p>
					With Jason as our group director, we lined up three samples; each of them cut down to bottling proof
					(94
					proof). We
					decided to keep the ages and the rickhouse locations a secret since we all knew that we would
					gravitate
					toward
					Deetsville warehouses. Per Jason's direction, everyone quitely worked through the samples before the
					opining began. We
					nosed them, recorded our thoughts, tasted, wrote down more notes and then finally we were ready to
					chat.
					Despite
					Langston, Evan, Austin and Belvin being on their first barrel selections; these guys were able to
					dive
					right in and
					provide some serious tasting notes.
				</p>

				<p>
					Three whiskies were poured; from left to right we had A, B and C. Since we all nosed first, then
					tasted,
					I was ready to
					get started. The nose on Whiskey A was pretty unremarkable to me; muted butterscotch and toffee.
					Whiskey
					B had a very
					unique nose that smelled like black licorice. It was very herbal and medicinal and just like black
					licorice; there's
					nothing else like it. I had never experience that in a bourbon before so I was very intrigued. The
					final
					nose for
					Whiskey C was classic bourbon; leather, smoke, tobacco, and some citrus sweetness in there.
				</p>

				<p>
					Having gone through and nosed them all, it was time for the tasting portion. I started with A and it
					was
					the most
					pedestrian and boring whiskey to me; just totally unremarkable. It was thin through the body and
					finished like getting
					punched with a pillow. Next up was B. For as much as I loved the unique nose on B, it sure didn't
					translate to a great
					whiskey. It had some earthy notes that I liked, but the structure and the body were not there.
				</p>

				<p>
					While the first two bourbons failed to ignite my flavor jets; Whiskey C got those burners going.
					This
					one had the best
					texture of the group and did a great job balancing some of the quintessential bourbon flavors. This
					one
					had a green
					apple note on the finish that was out of this world to me. For me, C was the clear and obvious
					winner. A
					second taste
					through only cemented my position: C was the best of the trio.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/20200904_2.JPG" alt="" /></span>
					Now having gone through the line up, the debate sparked up. Some folks loved A, some folks loved C,
					but
					no one loved B.
					It was pretty easy to kick that one out and so that was our first out. B was a whiskey from
					Bardstown
					Rickhouse V,
					fourth floor. For me and Langston, Whiskey C was the real winner. But some in the group championed
					hard
					for A. Jason
					remained our impartial mediator and poured us a little more from the sample bottle. After taking a
					final
					pass at the
					last two; it was an easy decision. Whiskey C was our selection.
				</p>

				<p>
					In a strange twist of fate, our top two whiskies were both from the famed rickhouses of Deatsville.
					Whiskey A was from
					the fourth floor of Deatsville D. Our winner was from the fourth floor of Deatsville F.
				</p>

				<p>
					Our winner is a very tasty 94 proof bourbon that was born on 1.18.2010. It's a little older than ten
					years and has a
					great flavor with one outstanding pedigree. This is another outstanding barrel for the Dallas
					Bourbon
					Club. This is the
					first Heaven Hill product that our group has selected and we are incredibly excited. Our sources say
					to
					expect in
					October or November. I can't wait to enjoy cool weather and this Deatsville beauty!
