					<h1>Review: Tiger Juice & Partagas Series D #4</h1>
					<p>This week, we've got a special treat. Not only do we have a member review, we've got the first
						ever Cigar & Whiskey
						pairing review. Brian McMeans put together this pairing and review for us earlier this week and
						I am excited to share it
						with you. Brian; take it away!</p>

				<p><b>Couple of quick notes:</b> I opened my Tiger Juice on Day 1 and enjoyed it, but I was not wowed by
					any means. I have always
					enjoyed the PSD4 and have never been let down by this smoke (probably smoked over 50 of these). I
					got a fresh box of
					PSD4’s on the day of the review. The box code was from January 2020, so this is the least aged PSD4
					that I have ever
					had.</p>
				<p><b>Review:</b> The PSD4 is a robusto sized cigar of Cuban origin and should be on the medium flavor /
					strength profile. The
					freshness of this cigar was evident from the barnyard and cedar aromas pre-light, but the leather
					and earthiness
					replaced that smell quickly upon toasting and lighting the cigar. First couple of draws of smoke
					were full of leather
					and cedar, I was also getting a bit of white pepper.</p>
				<p>First pour of Tiger Juice was about 3 ounces, I let the alcohol vapors dissipate while prepping my
					smoke.
					After a quick
					swirl of the Tiger Juice (Pete and Michael Langston are right about legs for days), I’m off to the
					races!</p>
				<p>I took my time with the first pour and half of the PSD4. I have really begin trying to focus on the
					balance in Cigar /
					Whiskey pairing since the Zoom Happy Hour featuring Jake. I think these two go together perfectly
					bringing out some of
					the flavors that I adore in both whiskey and cigars. Leather and Woodiness are prevalent in this
					pairing with a hint of
					brown sugar (like homemade cookies). Cigar’s construction was flawless with a smooth draw and just
					the right amount of
					smoke; the bite on the Tiger Juice was just enough to let me take my time.</p>
				<p>At the halfway point, I needed a refill and decided to try a cube of ice in the second pour. Great
					call as both the TJ
					and the PSD4 opened up a bit. I was getting a bit more of the sweetness (Caramel, Brown Sugar,
					Vanilla, Creaminess) as
					these two hit their stride, I really wanted a homemade cookie at this point. The second half of the
					cigar seemed to fly
					by with the final third adding an additional jolt of nicotine and white pepper.</p>
				<p><b>Overall:</b> What a great pairing! The flavors and strength of both, really complement each other.
					The only flavor that
					seemed to be washed out was the oak of the TJ (replaced with a sweet cedar). The PSD4 is definitely
					a medium to strong
					smoke at this age, and the flavors are pretty intense (should age well if I don’t smoke them all
					quickly). I can’t wait
					to try the Tiger Juice with an aged PSD4!</p>
