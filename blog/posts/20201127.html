					<h1>Holiday Whiskey Gift Giving Guide 2020</h1>
					<p>As today is often an outsized celebration of capitalism, I figured I would indulge in the fun and
						provide y'all with my
						annual Whiskey Gift Giving Guide. There are a lot of magazines, websites, and blogs that will
						recommend
						you buy whiskey
						stones or other worthless trinkets. I try to frame this list every year as a practical list of
						gifts
						that my fellow
						enthusiasts would actually want and use throughout the year. Additionally, I try to recommend
						some
						realistic gifts that
						will have a wow factor for the recipient.</p>

					<b><u>Something for the Bourbon-loving Foodie</u></b>
					Bourbon can lead you into a lot of things. Most of the time, it's hangover. But sometimes, it can
					lead
					you to a whole
					new world. For me, that was the wonderful world of country ham. Benton's may be the gold standard in
					country ham. The
					foodie in your life will love a pack of <a href="https://shop.bentonscountryham.com/">Benton's</a>
					bacon or a whole ham leg. If you would rather give
					them
					a little more
					direction, check out <a
						href="https://www.amazon.com/Bourbon-Bacon-Ultimate-Souths-Favorite/dp/0848743164">Morgan
						Murphy's Bacon & Bourbon.</a>
				</p>

				<p>
					<b><u>For the Bourbon Lover with everything</u></b>
					<a href="http://www.icemadeclear.com/">Ice Made Clear.</a> I love clear ice. Nothing elevates a
					cocktail or a bar like a block of solid,
					transparent ice. A ton of
					devices promise clear ice, but they can be clunky or flat out ineffective. Ice Made Clear has been
					my
					favorite ice
					making system and it produces crystal clear ice every time. It takes up little space in the freezer
					too.
					I love mine.

				<p>
					<b><u>Something for the Bourbon Newbie</u></b>
					You can always give a budding bourbon enthusiast a bottle of something good, or maybe a unique store
					pick. But if they
					are really turning the corner from Bourbon Curious to Bourbon Obsessed, a subscription to <a
						href="https://www.bourbonplus.com/subscription-offers/">
						Bourbon
						Plus
						magazine
					</a> is a
					great gift. Each issue features beautiful photography and very thoughtful journalism on our beloved
					hobby. Learning
					about the stories and the people behind it all will truly elevate their knowledge base and further
					hook
					them.
				</p>

				<span class="image right"><img src="../images/20201127_5.JPG" alt="" /></span>
				<p>
					<b><u>For the Whiskey-loving in law</u></b>
					A whiskey loving in law definitely wants whiskey as a gift, but sitting around on Christmas morning
					with
					the kiddos may
					make unwrapping a bottle a little...taboo. That's where these <a
						href="https://whiskeybytheglass.com/product/glencairn-cufflinks/">Glencarin Cufflinks</a> come
					in. A little
					classier than a
					fifth of Turkey under the tree, and just the right amount of fun for the in law who loves to imbibe
					with
					you.

					<b><u>Something for the Bourbon-loving Bookworm</u></b>
					<a
						href="https://www.amazon.com/Pappyland-Story-Family-Bourbon-Things/dp/0735221251/ref=sr_1_1?crid=34RG4Q8LYMLAA&dchild=1&keywords=pappyland+wright+thompson&qid=1606160483&sprefix=wright+thompson%2Caps%2C222&sr=8-1">Pappyland
						by Wright Thompson.</a> You will probably recognize Wright Thompson from ESPN's College Game
					Day.
					He's often the
					guy going off on tangents about football, the culture of the SEC, and things along those lines.
					Aside
					from Saturday's in
					the fall, Thompson is actually a pretty accomplished writer and his latest work is right up our
					alley.
					Thompson tells
					the story of Julian Van Winkle and his quest to make fine whiskey like his beloved Pappy did, but so
					much more. As he
					often does at ESPN, Thompson weaves the lore and romance of the past into the modern era and how we
					can
					move into the
					future while leaving some of it behind. I was gifted this book already and can not wait to crack it.

				<p>
					<b><u>Something for Yourself</u></b>
					It's hard to drop enough subtle hints to your loved ones for what you truly want, so I always
					advocate
					buying a little
					something for yourself. I'll finally admit it: the famous DBC Scepter is a <a
						href="https://www.riedel.com/en-us/shop/riedel-veritas/spirits-644900071">
						Reidel Veritas Spirits
						glass.
					</a>
					You'll be on
					your own to engrave it, but now you finally know where to buy this long stemmed, totally pretentious
					whiskey sipping
					glass. After all the questions I got about this glass, I hope you all go out and get one for
					yourself.
					Short stems are
					for peasants these days. It's time to enjoy whiskey way up top.
