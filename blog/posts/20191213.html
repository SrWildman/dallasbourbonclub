					<h1>Recap: Third Annual Christmas Party</h1>
					<p>It was this time last year where Brian and I looked at each other and thought: "How will we ever
						top that Christmas
						Party?" And here we are at the end of 2019, and once again I'm thinking: How will we ever top
						THAT?? True to form, this
						was an evening for the record books where the bar was set even higher. Here's some of the major,
						safe for work,
						highlights!</p>

				<p>Next year, the DBC will be picking a <b>Colonel EH Taylor Single Barrel as our charity bottle</b></p>

				<p>We collected <b>395 pounds of canned food for the North Texas Food Bank</b></p>

				<p>We raised <b>$7,000 for Dallas Habitat for Humanity</b></p>

				<p>The Evening's Big Winner: Shawn Z aka Mr Stagg. Not only did Z win the 1964 George T Stagg, he won a
					2018 George T Stagg
					which was promptly opened and enjoyed among the members.</p>

				<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/20191213_2.png" alt="" /></span>It was fantastic getting
					together and meeting everyone's significant others. Our get togethers really
					help cement us as
					a group focused on events: yes Facebook and emails are cool, but getting together in person and
					enjoying
					some whiskey is
					what it's really about. We've got a really neat group of people here and it's been nothing short of
					astounding to watch
					these friendships blossom and grow over the years.We continue to grow this organization the right
					way:
					adding whiskey
					lovers who enjoy meeting other whiskey lovers.</p>




				<p>So enough with the blah
					blah. Let's talk about the whiskey. Because there was PLENTY of amazing
					whiskey
					up on the big
					bar. As you can see, people had options. And all options were good ones. I got to enjoy some great
					stuff
					that I've had
					my eye on: New MGP Remus bourbon, Heaven Hill's new Bonded Bourbon as well as some old stuff I
					thought I
					would never see
					again: like the absolutely DIVINE 2018 OWA pick from Lakewood.</p>

				<p><span class="image right"><img src="../images/20191213_3.png" alt="" /></span>But what blew me out of
					the water was a 1992 Elijiah Craig 12 year old bourbon. And for those that
					don't
					know, that
					whiskey pre-dates the great fire at Heaven Hill. It was my first experience having anything HH
					pre-fire
					and my goodness:
					the hype is real. That was one of the most unique flavor profiles that I've ever had the privilege
					of
					enjoying. A huge
					nod of appreciation and bourbon pinache to the great Aaron Konen for this sublime treat.</p>


				<p>Of course that does not discount any of the great whiskey that was shared. We had Maker's Mark 101,
					the
					new outrageous
					Baker's 13, we had a 2015 William LaRue Weller, and as soon as I hit the door I was handed a
					Blanton's
					Straight from the
					Barrel from Jason...Our Christmas Party is truly a whiskey lovers dream and the only reason it is so
					special is because
					of this group and their generosity. So Cheers to that!</p>
