					<h1>Is This the End of Jim Murray?</h1>
					<p>It's that time of the year when I get to rail against my least favorite self-aggrandizing
						know-it-all. For years, Jim
						Murray has published his Whiskey Bible with hundreds of reviews from whiskey all over the world.
						This year, the top
						prize goes to Alberta Premium Cask Strength Rye Whisky from Beam Suntory's Alberta Distillers.
						Normally, the folks in
						Chicago would be elated to celebrate on of the industry's highest honors. But this is 2020, and
						there's always something
						else going on...</p>
				</header>
				<div class="image main"><img src="../images/20200925_1.JPG" alt="images/pic01.jpg" /></div>

				<p>
					Murray has been using crass and objectifying language in his reviews for a long time. When you read
					those words and then
					look at that picture; your skin crawls. <a
						href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/felipeschrieberg/2020/09/20/jim-murray-whisky-bible-sexism/#779d52433e31">You
						can read more about the comments he's made and his
						response
						here.</a> I'd also
					recommend reading whiskey author, <a
						href="https://thewhiskeywash.com/lifestyle/opinion-sexism-has-no-place-in-whisky-writing-mr-murray/">Becky
						Paskin's take on the subject.</a>

					It's a weird climate that we live in: I'm sure some people will be calling this another episode of
					cancel culture, and
					the other side will say this is a push for inclusion. Personally? I think Jim Murray has had his
					importance vastly
					overblown for a long time. While there's no denying he's made a name for himself, but the completely
					hyperbolic way that
					he writes, while equating himself and his whiskey tasting process to something divine, is just so
					off
					putting. He's
					certainly prolific in terms of the number of reviews that he has published, but you'd be hard
					pressed to
					find few people
					in the spirits industry that actually like the guy. It's a big step for a billion dollar global
					brand to
					renounce a
					major prize. And they aren't alone. Distilleries across the world are condemning Murray and his
					words.
					For someone who
					depends on early access from distilleries to their limited releases? Things do not look good for Jim
					Murray.
				</p>

				<p>
					I've never been shy about my dislike for the guy. I've often wondered who actually buys each years
					whiskey bible, let
					alone reads it. Obviously, it's a big deal to win top honors from Murray as it can truly elevate a
					brand, but there seem
					to be so many other, better sources for reviews and opinions on the industry. For me? This will be
					the
					last time that I
					mention Murray in a newsletter. I think he's a complete jerk and you're better off getting your
					tasting
					notes from Fred
					Minnick or any of the other one billion whiskey blogs out there.
				</p>

				<p>
					Whiskey isn't just a boys club any more. It's not just the drink of old men either. In fact, getting
					pigeonholed into
					those two categories nearly saw the entire bourbon category die off in the late seventies and
					eighties.
					And these words
					are not a tweet from a long time ago that was recently uncovered. This is stuff that the guy
					published
					<b><i>this year</i></b>. To me?
					That just proves a certain tone-deafness that's indefensible. While I wish for no one to go down in
					flames, I have to
					say that things are not looking good for Jim Murray.
