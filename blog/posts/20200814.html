				<p>
					Whether it's their larger than life founder, or the fact that they are aging bourbon in Las Vegas
					desert, you've heard
					of Smoke Wagon Bourbon by now. A few weeks ago, the nascent brand landed here in North Texas and it
					had
					the bourbon
					drinking masses going wild. While I missed out on the drop here in Dallas (a common theme in my
					life), I
					was able to
					grab a bottle from the Great Sam Wildman as he came back from some time away in Upstate New York.
					Here's
					my review on
					the bourbon that everyone talking just a few weeks ago.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Appearance:</b> Medium brown, solid amber
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Nose:</b> Lots of honey suckle: very sweet and savory. I'm picking up chocolate, dark figs, cedar
					wood.
					Despite the proof,
					there is little alcohol vapor. This is a nice nose with a pretty decent amount of complexity.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Taste:</b> The honey notes are strong. It's sticky sweet with that honey from the nose and bright
					floral
					notes that really
					dominate the front out. It's got an outstanding texture as well. This whiskey ends with like a tawny
					port: sticky sweet
					but a very robust savory element behind the initial bouquet.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>With Ice:</b> The nose transforms from sweetness to savory short bread and lots of delicious
					baking
					spice,
					lots of notes of
					vanilla once this opens up. It's a lovely nose when you add some water. As far as taste goes, this
					is a
					delicious fruit
					bomb up front: confectionery sugar and all sorts of great notes for with a sweet tooth.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Verdict: 92/100.</b> I'm a believer. I think this is really good stuff. It's got a unique nose
					and a
					novel
					taste that will
					impress you. This taste profile is unlike any MGP product that I've ever got to sample. I'm really
					impressed. I had a
					Desert Jewel Single Barrel a few months ago and enjoyed that one immensely so my expectations were
					high.
					This whiskey
					did not disappoint.
