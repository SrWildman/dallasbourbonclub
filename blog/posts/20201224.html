					<h1>Whiskies of the Year</h1>
					<p>Strictly speaking of bourbon, 2020 was a pretty good year. I feel that there were a lot of
						outstanding priced fairly.
						While bourbon is still highly coveted and anything new is gobbled up immediately, 2020 was not a
						year where you needed
						to spend hundreds of dollars on a bottle to get something quality. Quite the opposite; lots of
						delicious whiskey hit the
						shelves priced for everyone to enjoy. The hyper-allocated products were pretty outstanding this
						year as well. If you
						were lucky enough to get something on the ultra rare side; chances are you were pretty happy
						about the whiskey in the
						bottle.</p>

				<p>
					But as we are wired to do as Americans, there has to be a winner. There has to be drama and
					competition
					with a clear
					outcome and decisive winner. The following are my favorite categories when it comes to looking back
					at a
					year in whiskey
					and an attempt to highlight some of the standouts that came my way.
				</p>

				<p>
					<u><b>Best Every Day Drinker</b></u>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Old Forester Bottled in Bond
					</li>
					<li>
						Wild Turkey Rare Breed - 116.8
					</li>
					<li>
						Old Tub Bottled in Bond
					</li>
					<li>
						Elijah Craig Barrel Proof - Batch B520
					</li>
				</ul>
				My definition of an every day drinker is something that's available (without getting in line at 7
				AM)
				and something
				that's affordable (generally under $60). This is always a tricky one because there lots of great
				whiskies that just
				skirt this line. For instance, Booker's Boston Batch is just an incredible bourbon and deserves a
				nod,
				but it's outside
				the price range. For me, one of the best bourbons I had all year was Elijah Craig Barrel Proof -
				Batch
				B520. It's
				getting harder to find at $60, but it can still be done. The second release of ECBP this year was
				just
				outstanding and
				one that blew me away from first sip to final pour. In a very close second is Rare Breed 116.8. I
				think
				I drank a case
				of that stuff this year. This was a hard call, but ultimately the ECBP edges out, but you really
				can't
				go wrong.
				</p>

				<p>
					<u><b>Best Local Single Barrel</b></u>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Dallas Bourbon Club's EH Taylor Single Barrel
					</li>
					<li>
						Spec's Willet Family Estate Bourbon: Time Changes Everything
					</li>
					<li>
						Goody Goody's Four Roses Single Barrel OESQ
					</li>
					<li>
						Lakewood Medallion's Eagle Rare: Bourbon Now & Forever
					</li>
					<li>Pogo's 1792 Full Proof</li>
				</ul>

				When I started compiling a whiskey of the year award, I had no idea that the Dallas Bourbon Club
				would
				grow into the
				barrel picking machine that it would be today. So needless to say, it's incredibly hard for me to
				remove
				my personal
				pride and bias from this section. That's a very long introduction to say the best local single
				barrel
				bourbon was the
				Dallas Bourbon Club's EH Taylor. Yes, it's ours. Yes, I helped select it. But more importantly, that
				whiskey provided
				90,000 meals to people who need our help. It's a huge accomplishment that took a lot of people, a
				lot of
				coordination.
				More than that, it shows how a group of people united in their passion can do some real good. All of
				those platitudes
				are not meant to distract from the whiskey either: this is phenomenal bourbon. It's delicious,
				complex
				and truly
				outstanding for what you're tasting at 100 proof. My silver medal would go to Spec's 8 Year Willet
				Family Estate
				Bourbon. This is another special whiskey and the Spec's team picked an absolute diamond with this
				one.
				</p>

				<p>
					<u><b>The Worst of 2020</b></u>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Heaven Hill Select Stock: Coffee Barrel Finish
					</li>
					<li>
						Hirsch: The Horizon
					</li>
				</ul>


				It pains me to put a Heaven Hill submission on this list, but the distillery only release of their
				coffee barrel
				finished whiskey is dreadful and by pointing it out as a failure, I hope that I can stop other
				distilleries from
				replicating this monstrosity. However, the real travesty here is that I'm talking about the new
				Hirsch:
				The Horizon two
				weeks in a row. It's an affront to its predecessors and it's the worst bourbon I had in 2020.
				</p>

				<p>
					So that's the worst of the lot, now let's talk about the best.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b><u>The Best Whiskey of 2020</u></b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Knob Creek 12 Year Bourbon
					</li>
					<li>
						Sagamore Calvados Finished Rye
					</li>
					<li>
						George T Stagg
					</li>
					<li>
						Wild Turkey 17 Year Bottled in Bond
					</li>
					<li>Elijah Craig Barrel Proof - Batch B520</li>
				</ul>

				Yes, my repertoire of the ultra rare stuff is a little thin this year, but I can say there are some
				surprises on here.
				Knob Creek's 12 Year Bourbon was fantastic stuff and widely available. Sagamore's Calvados Finished
				Rye
				was some of the
				best finished whiskey I had this year and also not terribly hard to find. The lover of Wild Turkey
				in me
				really enjoyed
				the 17 year old at 100 proof. While those are delicious whiskies and worthy of all the accolades
				heaped
				upon them,
				George T Stagg is my whiskey of the year. Bouncing back from a lackluster 2019 (if you ask the
				fans),
				this years highly
				desired iteration clocks in at 130.4 proof and is more than 15 years old. Tasting this whiskey is
				about
				as close to
				sublime as it gets. It's robust in flavor, yet delicate and complex. For clocking at 130 proof, it
				drinks like something
				with far less octane. Harlan absolutely nailed this years release and it's got to be my favorite
				whiskey
				in 2020. Is it
				a cop out to pick a BTAC? We all know they are going to be great. But it's those high expectations
				getting shattered by
				this whiskey are what make it so special. It's that good. So good, it'll make you want to take a
				bite
				out of it.
