					<h1>An Ode to Bottle Killing Mode</h1>
					<p>Life is full of passing seasons; sometimes it’s hot, sometimes it’s cold, sometimes you’re flush
						and
						sometimes you’re
						clipping coupons. And before I get too esoteric, I’ll bring it back to our beloved spirit:
						sometimes
						you’re opening
						bottles and sometimes there’s clean up to do.</p>

				<p>Yes, I’m talking about bottle killing mode. When you’ve got great and exciting stuff waiting in the
					wings, but you just
					can’t bring yourself to open it right now. Bottle killing mode is when you’ve got to finish off your
					open whiskies
					because you are tired of looking at those same old suspects. Sometimes it can be great fun: you get
					to
					focus on things
					that you bought for a reason. Sometimes it can be terrible: you didn’t finish that bottle for a
					reason
					and you just
					can’t find a friend to take it away. Great or average, fantastic or poor; you’ve got open whiskey
					that
					ain’t going
					anywhere.</p>

				<p>It sort of creeps up on you. For weeks you’re trying new stuff and opening fantastic whiskey and then
					all of a sudden:
					the cabinet overfloweth. And so, when it comes time to cull the herd, you’ll find that those two
					ounce
					pours become five
					ounce pours in a pursuit to clean out the old. Normally, the bourbon comes to the equator of that
					big
					ice block, but
					when you’re in bottle killing mode, that old boy is swimming. The heavy hand of bottle killing mode
					can
					be a glorious
					and downright crazy thing.</p>

				<p>Perhaps "bottle killing mode" is a bit of a harsh term. Kind of sounds like I'm going to take these
					empties out and
					blast em with a pistol...Maybe I should call it "cabinet turnover."</p>

				<p>Whatever we should call it, let's give a cheers to out with the old and in with the new. Cheers to
					you
					Bottle Killing
					Mode! Remember; you bought those whiskies for a reason and just try to remember that initial
					excitement
					while you finish
					it. Maybe you got burned by high price, maybe it just underwhelmed you.</p>
