					<h1>Pete's Holiday Bourbon Gift Guide</h1>
					<p>While I can't help you find BTAC or Pappy for anything less than a car payment, I can help you
						with a few
						whiskey-centric gifts that are affordable and available. Also, I like to make this list so that
						people don't get you
						whiskey stones. Don't get whiskey stones.</p>

					<li><b>For the whiskey loving boss you need to impress:</b>This one always depends on the boss, but
						I
						would
						think a bottle of
						the Texas SamuRye would show you are fine, worldly employee. Great bosses deserve unfiltered,
						Sagamore
						greatness.
						However, if you don't want to hand your boss some booze and would rather keep it for yourself,
						check out
						<a href="https://oakandbondcoffee.com/">Oak & Bond
							Barrel Aged Coffee.</a> Delicious coffee that I guarantee they've never had.</li>
					<li><b>For the whiskey lover who has everything:</b> Del Maguey <a
							href="https://www.totalwine.com/spirits/tequila/del-maguey-pechuga-mezcal/p/134817750">Pechuga
							Mezcal</a> or the outstanding
						<a href="https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/b/339/foursquare-rum">Foursquare Rum.</a>
						Both fantastic
						products that will give the snob in your life something new to try.</li>
					<li><b>For the Bourbon Newbie:</b> <a
							href="https://fourrosesbourbon.com/blog/four-roses-small-batch-select-coming-spring-2019/">Four
							Roses Small Batch Select.</a> Priced just right and you can find
						it in
						most
						places. The
						different blends in here should get them excited about Four Roses and what each recipe can do
					</li>
					<li><b>For the chocolate loving spouse in your life:</b> <a
							href="https://arteatables.com/single-flavor-truffles/">Art Eatables</a> is a fantastic shop
						in
						Louisville
						that does
						some of the
						finest bourbon balls in the world. A couple dozen of these should help them forget about all
						those
						bottles that keep
						showing up in the mail...</li>
					<li><b>For the Bookworm:</b> the great Aaron Goldfarb put out a great new cocktail recipe book. <a
							href="https://www.amazon.com/Gather-Around-Cocktails-Celebrate-Holidays/dp/1732695229">Gather
							Round
							Cocktails</a>. Goldfarb
						wrote about the DBC in Bourbon+ a few months back and is a regular contributor to Whiskey
						Advocate
						magazine. If you'd
						rather a more traditional book: I am a huge fan of reading biographies and one worth reading is
						<a
							href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0970586108?pf_rd_p=ab873d20-a0ca-439b-ac45-cd78f07a84d8&pf_rd_r=5TZHJ2G6RJ8KHFNRZHSF">Bill
							Samuel's Jr
							Autobiography.</a> Bill is a great friend of the DBC and the guy can tell a story. This book
						is full
						of the
						amazing tales of
						his life and shows an inside look at one of the most iconic brands in bourbon.</li>
					<li><b>A little something for yourself:</b> Our pals at the Bourbon Pursuit podcast turned me onto
						this
						one. <a href="https://agedandore.com/products/travel-decanter?variant=30902889480332">The
							Travel Decanter
							from Aged & Ore.</a> This beauty is perfect for camping, tailgates, travel. I want one!!
						Tell them
						you heard
						about it on
						Bourbon Pursuit.</li>
