					<h1>EH Taylor Donation</h1>
					<p>oday marks the completion of a journey roughly eight months in the making.
						From the time we announced the DBC's EH Taylor pick at the Third Annual Christmas Party, to
						today; the Taylor Barrel
						campaign has been one hell of a ride.</p>

				<p>
					Nearly a year ago, we handed a $10,000 check to the NICU at UT Southwestern. The money we raised
					went to
					helping the
					healthcare providers for some of the most vulnerable people in our society: sick children. The money
					we
					raised with that
					barrel went to training equipment for doctors and nurses to better care for little babies during
					some of
					the hardest
					moments of their, and their parents lives. Quick shout out to Walker and his family, as their new
					baby
					girl left the
					NICU and is finally headed home.
				</p>

				<p>
					The money and the efforts behind it, no doubt positively impacted people around our community. For
					someone who has put a
					lot of time into this organization, the Blanton's campaign represented a successful proof of
					concept: we
					really can do
					some great things. It also represented a promise fulfilled: The Dallas Bourbon Club does what they
					say
					they will, and
					truly wants to do some good around the community: it's not always all about the bourbon. It's also
					at
					that moment that
					our club began to hit its stride. We grew up a lot that day.
				</p>

				<p>
					So when Brian handed me an envelope at last year's Christmas Party that said our next barrel
					selection
					was going to be
					an EH Taylor Single Barrel Bourbon, I knew we really had something here. Our partners at Buffalo
					Trace/Sazerac really
					understood what we were doing. They trusted us enough with a Blanton's and now; they were handing us
					the
					keys to a
					pretty spectacular kingdom. EH Taylor is certainly delicious and has an incredible pedigree, but
					they
					were seriously
					giving us a medallion'd EH Taylor bottle. I could not believe it at all. And the news absolutely lit
					the
					room ablaze:
					the Dallas Bourbon Club was riding a major wave that night. Later in the evening Brian pulled me
					aside
					and said: "We
					have to double the Blanton's donation with this." The gamut had been thrown: $20,000 was the goal
					for
					this new campaign.
				</p>

				<p>
					Fast forward to January 2020. It was a pretty cold day in Frankfurt that day in late July. Having
					been
					to Buffalo Trace
					for a pick previously, I had super high hopes for this day. My sky high expectations were absolutely
					shattered: a VIP
					tour with Freddy Johnson, tasting Taylor straight out of the barrel, getting to taste uncut Eagle
					Rare,
					the list goes on
					and on. But we were there for a purpose: Pick a barrel of Taylor that is going to some serious good
					for
					our community
					and we left Kentucky that night with a fantastic whiskey picked out.
				</p>

				<p>
					While we waited for our Taylor to arrive and for the group to get to work raising money, a little
					thing
					called the
					coronavirus showed up. Things got bad, then they got worse, then the shut down came. Every single
					facet
					of American life
					was disrupted while we stayed at home. At first, things were a little fun: toilet paper becoming as
					allocated than
					Buffalo Trace, and all night Tiger King binges. But as the days turned into weeks, things continued
					to
					deteriorate.
					People started losing their jobs and it was clear that our community was in crisis.
				</p>

				<p>
					The leadership team received a lot of great charity idea submission for this barrel, but it just
					seemed
					tone deaf to
					focus our efforts elsewhere while the largest disruption since WWII had hit our community. So it was
					decided: We needed
					to help local families during this novel viral outbreak and the best charity to contribute to was
					the
					North Texas Food
					Bank. I remember walking into my local Tom Thumb when the idea hit me. I immediately called Daniel
					Palos. It was
					actually the first time I made a phone call with a face mask on. After reaching out to the NTFB and
					hearing that they
					are seeing the highest demand from local families in decades and that the National Guard was helping
					to
					distribute to
					North Texas Families: it was even more obvious. We had to chose the North Texas Food Bank. They
					needed
					our help.
				</p>

				<p>
					When the barrel finally arrived, the Dallas Bourbon Club worked like a well oiled machine. We had
					members volunteer to
					help out and make sure the drop went smoothly. We had new members eager to roll up their sleeves and
					plan things for the
					group. There were members buying a bottle to use to raise money for a charity of their own, outside
					of
					the NTFB. We had
					an elaborate network of bourbon transport going so everyone got one of the coveted Taylor bottles.
					In a
					first ever move:
					we put a couple bottles up on local secondary sites and truly super charged the donation efforts. It
					was
					truly
					incredibly. We nearly cleared the entire barrel in a weekend and by the end of week three; it was
					all
					accounted for.
				</p>

				<p>
					So when all the bottles had been moved, and all the money had been counted. We had done it. <u><b>
							Mission
							Accomplished.
						</b></u> Well,
					sort of. Except we didn't just double the Blanton's donation, we tripled it. That's right, we
					tripled
					it.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>The Dallas Bourbon Club EH Taylor Single Barrel raised $30,000 for the North Texas Foodbank.</b>
				</p>

				<p>
					Thirty. Thousand. Dollars. From a single barrel. Absolutely incredible. Even more incredible is the
					charitable impact
					that our donation will provide. Every $1 donated can provide three meals. This means that our
					donation
					is going to
					provide 90,000 meals to North Texas Families in crisis. 90,000 meals is a huge number: just try and
					put
					a face to those
					meals: hungry children, mom's & dad's who can't find jobs, senior citizens: all North Texas people
					who
					need help. The
					Dallas Bourbon Club was able to provide that help in a truly difficult time.
				</p>

				<p>
					To put this into more perspective, Palos, who is at the NTFB Mobile pantry Volunteer Distribution,
					texted me that 45
					cars were in line for food donations an hour before distribution started. 45 cars lined up at 8 AM.
					There is a lot of
					need here in North Texas for these kinds of services. We are helping families through an incredibly
					difficult time with
					our financial resources and by donating our time to help. This is doing some real, tangible good.
					These
					are real people
					that are going to directly benefit from our charitable efforts. It's absolutely amazing to me.
				</p>

				<p>
					And so in closing, I'd like to raise a glass to ALL of you. The Dallas Bourbon Club continues to
					soar to
					new heights.
					Each year, we grow in members and in accomplishments. In a year where we can't get together as a
					group,
					I feel like the
					bonds between our members have grown even stronger. It's been a weird year to say the least, but
					using
					the DBC as a
					community has kept me smiling. I am so proud of everyone and everything that we've been able to
					accomplish. Today, we
					can kick the boots up and enjoy our success and how far we've become. It's been an amazing ride so
					far,
					and I can't wait
					to see where we go from here.
				</p>

				<p>
					There are a lot of thank you's in order and there's plenty of people that I will inevitably miss.
					However, just know
					that your contributions played a part in our biggest charity donation to date.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Mark, we could not have done it without our partnership. The DBC isn't the DBC without our
						partnership
						with Lakewood
						Medallion. Thank you for all that you do for us month after month.
					</li>

					<li>
						Buffalo Trace. You are an unbelievable partner. You've put a lot of faith into us over the years
						and
						we have been able
						to do some amazing things together. I can't wait to see what the future holds
					</li>

					<li>
						Daniel Palos. Protecting our 501(c)3 is huge and your input will go a long way to making sure
						these
						donations are done
						the right way. I know you're a tax accountant by day, so thank you for putting your expertise to
						our
						cause. In addition,
						your efforts to get these marketed on the local secondary markets got our donations over the
						top.
						And it
						doesn't stop
						there, you helped to push the volunteer hours and made sure we didn't just cut a check and step
						away.
					</li>

					<li>
						Marcus Sepasnki. You were integral in collecting funds, organizing payments. It's an ugly job,
						but
						we
						aren't able to
						cut these types of checks to charity without your diligent efforts.
					</li>

					<li>
						Katelyn Canaan was our point of contact over at the NTFB and she was fantastic to deal with.
						Between
						volunteer
						requests, coordinating logos and messaging, as well as getting us an opportunity to come by; she
						was
						nothing short of
						fantastic to deal with.
					</li>

					<li>
						Phil Lamb. Organizing a group lunch was a great idea to help build some community with the
						members.
						It
						lead to one
						great time and one outstanding photo.
					</li>

					<li>
						Neil Ylanan. Thank you for your time, efforts and creativity on the mini Taylor's. While they
						may
						have
						been small,
						those helped raise some big cash and they sure looked good thanks to you. I'm not sure that a
						regular
						old unmarked
						sample bottle would have captured the dollars that those little birdies got.
					</li>

					<li>
						The Boots on the ground at Lakewood. You guys did amazing making sure the drop day went as
						smooth as
						possible. We were
						able to keep the riff raff out and get the bottles to all the right people.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					And of course, thank YOU to all of our members. It's probably not the best time in the world to go
					out
					and buy a $170
					bottle of whiskey, but you did it anyway. Your dedication to this organization and doing some good
					around the community
					got us to $30,000. This group absolutely amazes me and continues to do so year in and year out.
					Today is
					all about a
					huge accomplishment for not just a few people in the group, but for all the people in the group. I
					am so
					proud of each
					and every single one of you.
				</p>

				<p>
					In closing, I just want to reiterate how proud I am of this group. We've grown in size, but we've
					been
					able to stick to
					our core mission of enjoying great whiskey with great people while doing some wonderful things
					around
					the community.
					We've never lost sight of our main focus: how this delicious and American liquid is the bond between
					all
					of us. Not
					every organization can say that they've been able to keep the main thing, the main thing as they
					scale
					up. We are
					certainly the exception in this regard.
				</p>

				Pour something great tonight and kick back and relax. We've accomplished something pretty amazing. We've
				got a lot to be
				proud of today.
