					<h1>Whiskey Pairing: Pairing the Best Picture Nominee's with Bourbon</h1>
					<p>It's a crowded field of great movies. There's kind of a trend of darker, more serious movies this
						year.
						Here's what's
						going to help you make the most of movie watching season: pairing a little whiskey with some of
						the best
						films of the
						year.</p>

				<p>When College Football is over and done with and the clock is just about to strike Midnight for
					the NFL,
					it becomes movie
					watching season. The weather outside is crap, there's no really great sports on, so it's time to
					catch
					up on pop
					culture.</p>

				<p>And I am a serious movie buff. I watch a ton of movies and am a hopeless addict to streaming
					entertainment. My estemmed
					brother in law and his wife challenge me to watch every Best Picture Nominee that I can. This
					year, I
					thought I could
					help out the DBC by suggesting some delicious whiskey to compliment your viewing experience. And
					the
					nominees for Best
					Picture are...</p>

				<p><b>The Irishman:</b> Hancock's Presidential Reserve. While the film's main attraction, Jimmy Hoffa,
					didn't
					drink, you're going
					to want to stick with something on the lower proof side for this one. Clocking in at 3.5 hours,
					drinking
					anything barrel
					proof (or above 90 proof for that matter) will have you watching this movie in multiple sittings
					(true
					story: took me
					three sittings). Stick with Hancock's delicious 88.5 proof while you watch a young Robert DeNiro
					magically grow old
					again.</p>

				<p><b>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood:</b> J.W. Dant. An ode to old school Hollywood deserves a call back
					to a
					Hollywood legend. I
					choose J.W. Dant for this one as a call back to Paul Newman's fantastic movie, The Hustler, in which
					he
					requests J.W.
					Dant - no ice, no glass - in order to take on Fats Domino. Maybe a bit of a stretch? But I feel like
					it
					fits the vibe of
					Hollywood in the mid-century...back when they called movies "pictures." However, unlike Paul Newman,
					feel free to enjoy
					your J.W Dant with ice maybe? Definitely a glass though...</p>

				<p><b>A Marriage Story:</b> This is a pretty tense and pretty sad movie at times. Nothing about a brutal
					divorce
					and child custody
					battle screams "Good times and whiskey!" However, that's not to say this isn't an excellent movie.
					Both
					Ben Swollo and
					ScarJo are outstanding. So for this nuanced film, I'll recommend a nuanced whiskey: Sagamore Spirit
					Double Oaked.</p>

				<p><b>1917:</b> This World War I drama is still in theaters, so pairing it with good bourbon could prove
					difficult. If you are
					able to view this one in one of our city's cool hip movie theaters, I'm going to suggest a Maker's
					Mark
					Old Fashion.
					Enough proof and flavor to keep your heart rate down during the amazing camera work and intense
					action.</p>

				<p><b>Ford v Ferrari:</b> This love story about American Muscle Cars and cool sunglasses deserves some
					big ass
					American Whiskey.
					As an ode to American Muscle and the coolness of the late 60's, go with an American classic: Jim
					Beam on
					the rocks.</p>

				<p><b>JoJo Rabbit:</b> In full disclosure, I have not seen this one. But, given the themes, let's keep
					it light
					and not get too
					heavy. It's a story about young children in some pretty awful circumstances so grab that Buffalo
					Trace
					and keep it easy.</p>

				<p><b>The Joker:</b> Some people really loved this one, and some people found it completely off putting.
					I happen
					to be in the
					latter half of that group: Don't get me wrong, Joaquin is outstanding, but Todd Phillips' brutalist
					film
					made me want to
					call my parents and ask them for a hug. So I'm going to recommend skipping alcohol all together
					here.
					Get a nice warm
					glass of milk, a cozy blanket and have mom on speed dial.</p>

				<p><b>Parasite:</b> The South Korean film getting all buzz may be the dark horse to win this year. It's
					a
					psychological thriller
					that has everyone buzzing. It's a foreign film, it's dark and intense, take a flyer on this one and
					pick
					something wild.
					How about a Whistle Pig Cask Finished Rye?</p>

				<p><b>Little Women:</b> I grew up in a house full of men. I just don't think my brain is wired to enjoy
					dramatic
					period pieces
					about domesticity. I know in the end, I will be forced to sit through this one so I'm reaching for a
					healthy six fingers
					of 1792 Full Proof to get through this. Apologies to my wife, but I may deliberately doze off during
					this movie.</p>
