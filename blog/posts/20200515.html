				<p>If you can think back to DBC Virtual Happy Hour episode #4, you'd recall that pretty much half the
					group
					was drinking
					Belle Meade Bourbon Cask Strength Reserve. That's not really an exaggeration; half of the group was
					drinking that same
					expression. Now, if you've got a really good DBC memory, then you'd recall that I thought Belle
					Meade
					Cask Strength was
					one of the worst bourbons that I had in 2018. The Great Chad Nelson who bought one at the same time
					as
					me, even agreed:
					that bottle was terrible.</p>

				<p>But I got to thinking over the weekend: If half the group is drinking this particular bottle and even
					beating up our
					guest to provide batch and barrel information (only kidding Langston), then maybe this bourbon was
					worth
					a revisit. As
					fate would have it, I saw a bottle on sale at my local Goody as I was restocking on essential Wild
					Turkey Rare Breed. I
					figured, what did I have to lose? If I hated it again, then I knew a few people I could call to
					offload.
					So Sunday
					night, as my week was winding down, I thought I'd give it a go.</p>

				<p>And everything that I said about it in 2018 was totally wrong. This is outstanding whiskey. Maybe I
					got
					a bad batch?
					Maybe I was still a young neophyte in my bourbon journey? But what I tasted Sunday night was not the
					same thing that I
					had two years ago that is for damn sure.</p>

				<p>The morale of this story is that as time goes on, your tastes may change. You may have opened an old
					batch of something,
					hated it, gave it the ol' drain pour and then swore it off. You may be writing off something
					delicious
					when you do that.
					If I had stuck to my guns and never bought another Belle Meade Cask Strength Reserve, I'd be missing
					out
					on this
					beautiful gem. I think this rings especially true for the new guys. They really need some time to
					get it
					right, perfect
					their system and most importantly: become better blenders. While I can easily get off on a tangent
					on
					why blending may
					be the most important piece of the equation, I will refocus on the point of this section: Practice
					forgiveness when it
					comes to bourbon. Sometimes the first release is hot trash, sometimes they nail it, but chances are:
					if
					you are seeing a
					second release/multiple go-rounds for a certain product, give it another chance. It might even be
					better
					than you
					previously thought!</p>

				<p>A short memory and the power to forgive a bad release will take you far in this bourbon world. It's
					been
					a nice lesson
					for me to learn and I now have a delicious bourbon in my cabinet. Go out and revisit something you
					didn't like at first;
					you may just be totally surprised.</p>
