				<p>On Monday, I got some horrible news that my beloved uncle Tom had passed away. He was a huge
					inspiration
					on my life and
					spending summers at his house in North Carolina really shaped me. As a young man, he taught me some
					pretty important
					life skills: golf, poker, how to read a sports line. But he also taught me a lot about integrity,
					living
					up to your
					word, a love of your country and how important it is to be involved in local politics. He also tried
					to
					get me to like
					Duke Basketball & Rush Limbaugh so not all of his lessons necessarily stuck...</p>

				<p>Toward the end of his life, Tom decided that he had enough Jack Daniels and was ready to start
					learning
					about some real
					bourbon. In fact, he was a honorary member of the Dallas Bourbon Club and read every Friday bulletin
					since they started.
					He encouraged me to writing these and was so excited about everything this organization was doing.
					If
					there was ever an
					extra DBC pick, I packed one up and shipped it North Carolina for him. He was so blown away by the
					Old
					Forester bottle,
					he ordered a second one. It was such a joy for me to share this hobby with him and to connect with
					him
					on bourbon
					whiskey. He was a huge fan and always so excited to show off something a colleague bought him or
					what he
					won in poker
					game.</p>

				<p>It's easy to say that it's just a hobby, or that it's only whiskey. But for the real enthusiasts,
					bourbon has a really
					unique way to connect people. It's a common interest yes, but it can be the catalyst for connection,
					re-connection,
					stories and countless hours of conversation. American whiskey has always been a part of my family,
					but
					to discover
					connoisseurship with Tom was truly a huge joy of mine. I always happy to talk him off a Willet Pot
					Still
					ledge or help
					him organize his birthday bourbon tasting because it made an opportunity to catch up with him, chat
					about the Cowboys
					(he was a Saints fan and hated the Cowboys), talk about my son growing up, and so much more. I'll
					look
					back on those
					calls and FaceTimes and smile for the rest of my life.</p>

				<p>Some of the best advice I ever got, I got when I was in college. My friends dad told me: "The best
					thing
					you can ever do
					is spend five minutes and call your grandma on Sunday." Those words have really had an impact on me.
					Calls to my grandma
					turned into calls with Tom and those calls turned into some great whiskey down the road. Of course
					our
					relationship
					wasn't all about bourbon, but it was one facet to our relationship that was really meaningful and
					always
					a topic of
					conversation.</p>

				<p>In closing, this is a pretty special hobby that's so much more than collecting rare stuff or drinking
					limited releases.
					It's a hobby that connects people from all walks of life. It brings people together and creates fond
					memories that will
					last a lifetime. It's not supposed to be decisive. It's meant to be the opposite: to celebrate and
					to
					unify.</p>

				<p>Whiskey didn't make the bond between Tom and I, but it sure made it more fun. Always call those aunts
					&
					uncles, those
					cousins you grew up with, or your best friends on the other side of the country. You never know when
					they could be gone.
					And when the special people in your life are around; open the great whiskey. Never miss that
					opportunity
					to connect with
					them and make a special memory.</p>
