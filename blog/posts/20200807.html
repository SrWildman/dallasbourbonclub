					<h1>DBC North Texas Food Bank - Volunteer Hours</h1>
					<p>As you all know a group
						of ten DBC
						members helped volunteer last week at the NTFB Mobile Pantry donation. To set the scene, I got a
						text
						from Daniel Palos
						that 45 cars had lined up an hour before the pantry's donations actually began. That means there
						is some
						serious need in
						our community. Jeff Underwood was part of the volunteer effort and brings you this recap. I'll
						let Jeff
						take it from
						here.</p>

				<p>
					While raising donations and writing a checks to worthy non-profits is great, ten of DBC's best
					gathered,
					suited up and
					gloved to provide hands-on support to Dallas county's most needy last Friday. In continuance with
					the
					North Texas Food
					Bank's service to the community during the Covid-19 pandemic, Club members extended it's partnership
					with NTFB by
					handing out food at Jireh's Tabernacle Worship Center in Mesquite, TX on July 31.
				</p>

				<p>
					Following NTFB & OSHA safety protocols, drivers didn't leave their vehicles in the drive up line,
					and
					popped their
					trunks to allow for contactless receipt of life-sustaining boxes of food and other nourishment.
					Mostly
					cloudy skies and
					a good breeze only added to the already great mood everyone was in when we got there.
				</p>

				<p>
					Split into distribution teams, Club members integrated and made new friends with members of the
					church
					who were
					distributing. NTFB staff were super helpful (and thankful) our Club helped make sure they could
					focus on
					keeping the
					pallets of freshness coming, and handle the logistics of traffic and maximizing space. By the end of
					the
					morning, we'd
					handed out well over 200 boxes each of fruits/veggies, canned/boxed goods, and whole milk.
				</p>

				<span class="image right"><img src="../images/20200807_3.jpg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>
					We don't know the stories of the men and women that received a box of food, or a supply of milk. We
					don't know if they
					were working, when they'd had their last meal, or if they could pay all of their bills at home. But
					we
					in the Dallas
					Bourbon Club do know humanity. The line of cars wrapped around the block at the crack of dawn gave a
					strong visual of
					the need that exists in our community. And even behind the masked faces behind closed car windows,
					the
					eyes of the
					citizens we served told the story of their appreciation. The thumbs-up and prayer hands they gave as
					we
					loaded their
					vehicles, replaced the smiles we couldn't see and the hugs we couldn't give out. But at the end of
					the
					day...it was just
					as palpable.
				</p>

				<p>
					Mahatma Ghandi said, â€œA nation's greatness is measured by how it treats its weakest members". This
					also
					holds true for
					how we, the men and women of Dallas Bourbon Club, impact our neediest of neighbors.
