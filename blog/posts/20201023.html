					<h1>The Bourbon President: Harry Truman</h1>
					<p>If you're like me, then two things are on your mind:
					<ol style="text-align: center; list-style-position: inside;">
						<li>You're a history lover</li>
						<li>You are so
							beaten
							down by what has
							felt like an endless Election season.</li>
					</ol> This campaign has seemingly never ended...remember Michael
					Bloomberg? That was so
					long ago! The fireworks from last nights debate are still ringing in my ear...So this next post is
					not
					meant as a beat
					down regarding the Presidential Election, but an interesting piece of history that I found and
					wanted to
					share in honor
					of the American Presidency.</p>
				</header>

					When you think of whiskey and the American President, it's pretty easy to jump straight to Andrew
					Jackson or give the
					nod to FDR for repealing Prohibition. However, there is one pretty remarkable President that doesn't
					necessarily get the
					bourbon love that he deserves. In my opinion, that President is Harry Truman.
				</p>

				<p>
					Harry Truman is pretty fascinating guy: a military veteran from small town Missouri, ending World
					War
					Two, rebuilding
					Europe through the Marshall Plan, integrating the armed forces and laying the ground work for the
					Civil
					Rights movement;
					he accomplished a lot throughout his life and presidency having come from such humble beginnings. I
					highly recommend the
					Pulitzer Prize winning biography Truman by David McCullough. His accomplishments aside, I'd like to
					focus on Truman's
					unapologetic love of bourbon whiskey.
				</p>

				<p>
					Truman's morning routine included a two mile power walk and "an egg, a slice of toast, a slice of
					bacon,
					a glass of skim
					milk and a shot of Old Grand-Dad." President Truman claimed that a shot of bourbon in the morning
					"got
					the engine
					running." In fact, Truman's fondness for bourbon whiskey was so well known that in 1945, the Baptist
					General Convention
					of Texas tried to prevent Baylor University from giving Truman an honorary degree due to his
					fondness
					for bourbon and
					playing poker. It tough to say which bourbon was Truman's favorite because he certainly enjoyed a
					lot of
					them; the top
					two being Old Grand-Dad and Wild Turkey, however Old Forester and Old Crow were certainly in the
					mix.
					While campaigning
					against Thomas Dewey in 1948, Truman's fondness for bourbon was used as a way to humanize Truman and
					show that he was a
					regular guy, unlike the martini-drinking, elitist Governor of New York. The love of whiskey ran in
					the
					family as well.
					His wife, Bess, even schooled the White House bartender on how to make an Old Fashioned after
					several
					dismal attempts
					were not to her liking. To her, adding too much sugar or a cherry made it taste like fruit punch.

						Here's
						the recipe for
						the Truman Old Fashioned those interested
					</a>. While this may sound like he was a bit of a booze hound,
					Truman kept it to
					just a few drinks a night; a life long friend claimed "He can make a highball last longer than
					anybody I
					ever saw." In
					fact, just as our distilleries were beginning to produce whiskey instead of the industrial alcohol
					needed for the war
					effort, Truman made the difficult decision to shut them down for twenty days and sent the grain to a
					starving Europe
					instead.

						"As Americans, we believe that every man should be free to live his life as he wishes. He should
						be
						limited only by his
						responsibility to his fellow countrymen. If this freedom is to be more than a dream, each man
						must
						be
						guaranteed
						equality of opportunity. The only limit to an American’s achievement should be his ability, his
						industry
						and his
						character.”
