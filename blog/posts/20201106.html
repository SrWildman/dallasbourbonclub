					<h1>Update - Hurricane Relief for Southwest Louisiana</h1>
					<p>A few weeks ago, Chris Patterson approached the leadership and asked if he could sell his
						homemade
						chicken and sausage
						gumbo to raise money for areas of Southwest Louisiana that were affected by Hurricane Laura.
						While Chris
						was able to
						raise a nice bit of money for his cause, a second hurricane hit the community. Because of that,
						we
						decided to use our
						bourbon barrel honey for the same cause. The bourbon barrel aged honey is now nearly sold out,
						and it's
						gone to raise
						more money for the relief effort.</p>

					Which brings me to today. Remember the raffle for the $1,000 mint julep from Woodford Reserve? Well,
					the
					brand went
					ahead and donated the $2,800 we raised out of their own pocket. This leaves us with an extra $2,800
					that
					we raised in
					hopes of a charitable donation. Given what's happened to that part of Louisiana, and given some of
					our
					members close
					ties to the region, it only makes sense to put that money toward the hurricane relief effort.

					This brings our donation to the Community Foundation of Southwest Louisiana to <b><u>$5,700</u></b>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Chris, you've done an amazing job with this charity donation. From donating your time, your kitchen,
					making deliveries,
					and getting us behind this relief effort; this has been your show. Thank you for all that you've
					done on
					this one. Our
					hope is that this donation can go toward getting that region back on it's feet and helping families
					get
					their lives
					back.
				</p>

				<p>
					I called Chris last night to break the news, and he wanted to provide a heartfelt and personal thank
					you
					to the group
					for all of your help.
				</p>

				<p>
					I cannot express enough gratitude to everyone who participated in this fundraiser for the people of
					southwest Louisiana.
					I knew I needed to do something and also that the power of many is far greater than the power of
					one.
					This club
					continues to blow away any expectations I have in regard to its generosity for its membersâ€™ causes.
					When
					I heard how
					much we will be donating back home, it gave me goosebumps. I know this money will do so much good to
					help rebuild a
					beautiful part of this country and get people back on their feet. Thank you!
				</p>
