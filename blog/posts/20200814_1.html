					<h1>Getting Crafty with Michael Belvin</h1>
					<p>The 3D printed glencarin traveling case has been a huge hit around the club. It's a great gift
						idea for the bourbon
						lover in your life that already has everything (i.e it's a great gift to give yourself...you've
						been good this year).
						Much to the chagrin of my wife, I always bring this to a bourbon event or any kind of get
						together. She told me that I
						would never use something like this...and I'm the kind of person that goes out of their way to
						make a point.</p>

				<p>
					Anyway, the other day, I saw Michael Belvin's glencarin case that had been totally tricked out and
					looked amazing. Jason
					made the great suggestion to have Michael take us through the process and tell us how he made his
					case
					look like the
					amazing product that you see above. Michael: take it away!

				<ol>
					<li>
						In order to remove the 3D printing lines, sand the staves and heads of the barrel with 150 grit
						sandpaper making sure
						to avoid the hoops and bung area. Move to a 220 grit, then to 320 if you choose. This does not
						need
						to
						be uniform as
						barrels look beat up in warehouses and give it character.
					</li>
					<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/20200814_5.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

					<li>
						Wash and dry off the barrels so you can spray paint the whole barrel with thin coats of a black
						primer. I did 3
						coats.
					</li>
					<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/20200814_6.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

					<li>
						Once dry, I hand painted the barrel staves and heads with a modeling paint using a small paint
						brush.
						Bob Ross style,
						I blended a yellow and brown to get a color that seemed to match what I thought resembled the
						right
						color and made some
						happy little decisions. Since I was covering black, it took 3 coats I believe.
					</li>
					<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/20200814_4.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

					<li>
						Since the barrels needed to have an antiqued look, I dabbed a light amount of brown paint on a
						paper
						towel, wiped it
						on the staves, and quickly wiped off. This took me a minute to get my technique down. Again,
						irregularity is your friend
						here.
						<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/20200814_7.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
					</li>

					<li>
						Touch ups on the hoops and "DBC" lettering with black modeling paint was next using the same
						paint
						brush. I taped off
						the staves on either side of the hoops so the lines would be clean. Tedious, but worth it. I
						also
						used
						the silver paint
						for the rivets and the brown paint for the bung.
						<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/20200814_8.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
					</li>

					<li>
						Lastly, I used a semi-gloss spray varnish (exterior of course for any inclement weather I might
						be
						sipping bourbon
						in). Similar to the primer coats, I did very thing layers and let them dry for about 30 minutes
						between
						coats. I did 2
						coats the first day, let it dry overnight, sanded with 320 grit, and then did 2 more coats.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p>
					I am certainly missing something here as I am pulling this from memory, so I am happy to answer
					questions if you have
					them along the way or would love to hear how you improved on my process. <i>Note the spouse may not
						approve of the
						bourboncentric focus of this project, so be prepared to buy some wine or take-out to offset
						ðŸ˜Š</i>
