					<h1>MGP Barrel Selection</h1>
					<p>Thanks to the efforts of Nacho, we got an MGP barrel coming our way. Let me say that again: The
						Dallas Bourbon Club has
						a barrel of MGP bourbon and it's coming in September. Unreal!</p>
				</header>
				<div class="image main"><img src="../images/20200306_1.png" alt="images/pic01.jpg" /></div>

				<p>But let me tell you about how we got there. Yesterday evening, a small contingent of DBC members
					gathered at the
					Stablemade offices. We were joined by the MGP rep for Texas, Scott Vanderpool. If you are not
					familiar,
					MGP is one of
					the largest producers of alcohol in the entire world, and for many years, the company was incredibly
					secretive about who
					they were, what they did and what they produced. Additionally, they only produced wholesale products
					for
					independent
					bottlers. Thanks to MGP, Michter's has a 20 and a 25 year old bourbon, even though they themselves
					haven't been
					producing their own whiskey for that long. Some of the best whiskey in the world is made by MGP and
					it's
					not in
					Kentucky; it's in Indiana. Part of their recent DNA change is to open up and become a little more
					transparent about
					themselves and to go to market with their own products. That's where George Remus Bourbon comes in.
				</p>

				<p>After tasting through some of MGP's own branded portfolio, we had the Herculean task of selecting a
					single barrel
					bourbon from a group of four bourbons. Unbeknownst to us, these four bourbons were a selection of
					two
					different mash
					bills, multiple cooperage's, and varying proof points. Luckily, we had eight great palates in the
					room
					who were up for
					the challenge.</p>


				<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/20200306_2.png" alt="" /></span>And let me tell you:
					there was a ton of variance between these four bourbons. The first one that I
					tasted, Barrel #51
					was beautiful. It had a delicious, bright citrus taste and a great texture. The finish was long and
					beautiful. I
					thought: "Wow, this one can't be topped." And I was right: almost. The next two whiskies had a
					little
					more of a grainy
					taste and much less of a finish. The fourth sample, Barrel #497 threw me for a loop. This one
					matched
					51's great flavor,
					but it had a great, savory middle and a distinct finish. The group agreed: This was a two horse race
					between #51 and
					#497.</p>

				<p>Just as the group was beginning to opine the virtues of each barrel and argue their case, Scott got a
					little twinkle in
					his eye. He told us: "Before you make your final decision, you need to try these." That's when he
					pulled
					out two more
					barrel samples: Barrel #422 & #324. We were instantly intrigued. Barrel #324 had a beautiful honey
					taste
					to it, but had
					a thin body and a smokey finish. It did not hold up to #497. Barrel #422 was absolutely gorgeous. To
					me
					it was
					quintessential MGP: a great flavor on the front, outstanding texture and then a long, lingering
					finish.
					Barrel #422 was
					outstanding to me.</p>


				<p><span class="image right"><img src="../images/20200306_3.png" alt="" /></span>During our tasting,
					Scott kept the details of each barrel a complete secret. We didn't know proofs,
					mashbills, age,
					ANYTHING. We just knew it was MGP bourbon.</p>

				<p>After the tasting two new entrants, we had to start making a decision. When we put it to a vote,
					Barrel
					#51 only had one
					supporter, so it had to go. Deciding between #497 and #422 was a very difficult decision. However,
					when
					we put it to a
					vote, the panel chose #497 and it wasn't close. 5-2-1 was the count in favor of #497. There were
					some
					serious MGP lovers
					on that panel and to hear them passionately defend #497 means we've got a killer whiskey on it's
					way.</p>

				<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/20200306_4.png" alt="" /></span>In the grand reveal of
					the night, Scott gave us the skinny on each barrel. Barrel #422 was a high rye
					bourbon distilled
					in 2014 and bottled at 121 proof. She will be missed. Our winning selection, #497, was a low rye,
					wheated mashbill
					bourbon clocking in at 121.1 proof and also distilled in 2014. By the time this is bottled, it will
					be a
					true six year
					bourbon.</p>

				<p>And so there you have it: The Dallas Bourbon Club has an MGP barrel expected to land in September and
					it's damn good.
					This is one that you should be excited about, because I sure am. A huge thank you to Scott at MGP
					and
					the Stablemade
					guys for their hospitality and for hosting us. And a big round of applause to Nacho for coordinating
					this barrel pick
					and landing a great one. Can't wait!!!</p>
