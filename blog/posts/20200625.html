					<h1>Old Forester Barrel Proof Selection</h1>
					<p>On a very warm Thursday afternoon, I was joined by Brian, Dane Covey, Jeff Ridley, Daniel Palos,
						Dustin Stone, Mark
						Kumar, a few of his pals and Scott Berlin at the gorgeous <a
							href="https://www.thegaston.com/">Gaston Bed &
							Breakfast</a>. For those that
						don't know Scott, he is
						a DBC member and proprietor of the Gaston. It's a beautiful five room hotel and event space
						right in
						the heart of the
						city. It's absolutely gorgeous and is the perfect place for an event or a staycation...check it
						out!
					</p>

				<p>Setting aside, we had some work to do. The goal of the evening was to select an Old Forester Single
					Barrel Bourbon. But
					unlike our last trip to Whiskey Row; there would be no bottle proofing. This whiskey was going to be
					raw, uncut, and
					straight from the barrel. Alongside Scott, we were hosted by Tristan Westphal of Brown Forman, and
					virtually by Old
					Forester's own, Jim Lake (honorary DBC member) and our friend Tyler Mirt, the host of the single
					barrel program. After a
					few warm up drinks of Dust on the Barrel, the folks in Louisville were dialed in via WebEx. The
					evening was on...</p>

				<p>For a few members on the selection team, this was their first time. This created a real excited buzz
					in the room: It was
					Christmas Eve and Bourbon Santa Claus was nearly at the Gaston. Since we had a few first timers,
					Tyler started us off
					with a brief history on the brand but then provided a ton of cool insight into the science and
					process behind Old
					Forester bourbon. The coolest thing we learned was the heat cycling process. This process is how Old
					Forester gets a
					four to six year old bourbon to taste like something double it's age; it's how they get great young
					whiskey to taste so
					complex. After laying down some serious knowledge on us, Tyler then go to work on doing what he does
					best: breaking down
					the sensory experience and all of the elements involved when you taste bourbon. Tyler's walk through
					of the sensory
					experience and his methodology is so good, that I won't try to rehash it here: it's got be seen and
					heard in order to do
					it proper justice. To start, he primed our palettes with some signature Old Forester 86 proof
					whiskey and from there, we
					were off to the races.</p>

				<p><span class="image fit"><img src="../images/20200625_2.png" alt="" /></span>In front of us were
					three samples of totally uncut Old Forester. Each of them had gut busting proofs
					over 125. This was
					some serious stuff. By request, Tyler kept all fo the proofs and ages a secret until we had chosen a
					winner. This way we
					could let the best whiskey do the talking and not just pick a paper tiger.</p>

				<p>The first whiskey had a really nice nose; heavy on the banana notes. But the alcohol vapor was pretty
					intense. Tasting
					this at first, it had a lot of delicious honey notes as well as a really unique taste of cedar. The
					viscosity was
					absolutely outstanding. Tyler is a big proponent of going back and revisiting each whiskey as the
					second time around,
					your palette is more acclimated to high alcohol. So the second taste produced a very pleasant orange
					zest and maple
					syrup. Adding a few drops of water yielded mixed results: less burn and outstanding chocolate notes,
					but more of a
					grainy finish.</p>

				<p>The second whiskey had the best nose of the lot. It was nutty, chocolatey and overall, just very
					savory. It was a lovely
					nose. The taste was just as good: a ton of complexity upfront and then robust oak and baking spices
					going down. My
					second taste provided more of the same: really rustic, really complex with one amazing texture. My
					immediate comparison
					was a Elijah Craig Barrel Proof. It was a testament to the Old Forester process because this whiskey
					tasted like an ECBP
					that is more double the age on the Forester.</p>

				<p>The third whiskey had a unique nose, not the best, just a little off the wall: spearmint and cedar.
					It drank like a
					brick though: hard to discern specific flavors other than a full-bodied bourbon. My second pass a
					little better:
					buttered toast with that unique mint snap at the end. I really liked this one with water because it
					brought out a lot of
					the subtleties.</p>


				<p><span class="image right"><img src="../images/20200625_3.png" alt="" /></span>After the group tasted
					through everything, the traditional riffing and politicking began. Everyone
					trying to argue their
					case for the best in the lot. The conversation quickly evolved into a philosophical one: Do we pick
					a great tasting Old
					Forester? Or, do we pick something off the wall that we've never had before? It was clear that
					whiskies #1 and #3 were
					noble expressions of Old Forester. However, there's always a dark horse and that one was whiskey #2.
					As Palos put it:
					Whiskey #2 was a wild stallion. And he wasn't wrong: it was an absolutely delicious wild card.</p>

				<p>If you think back to the story of Dust on the Barrel, this is the very same dilemma that we ran into:
					Play it down the
					middle and pick a great tasting whiskey that would have broad appeal? Or do we pick something bold
					and adventurous? Last
					time, we took the former option and picked a great tasting product that became Dust on the Barrel.
				</p>

				<p>With this moral dilemma on our minds, we put it to a vote. On the first pass, Whiskey #1 was quickly
					voted out, leaving
					#2 and #3, the wild pony or the safe play. On a head to head, final vote, it was a clear decision.
					The group wanted to
					run free like the stallion that is Whiskey #2. The Wild Pony was just too good to let go; we had to
					tame this beautiful
					beast. Tyler agreed: Whiskey #2 was the oldest and highest proof of the lot, a great choice indeed.
				</p>



				<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/20200625_4.png" alt="" /></span>This enigmatic whiskey
					we selected was bottled on May 7, 2015 and bottled at a whopping 135.4 proof.
					It was rested near
					a window in Warehouse K.</p>

				<p>Our selection is going to be one fantastic whiskey that is worth chasing. It's delicious, it's
					complex and it's unlike
					anything we've ever selected. If it weren't for the bottle, you'd never believe it was Old Forester.
					Can't wait till we
					get our hands on this one later this year.</p>

				<p>As always, a huge thank you to <a
						href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/lakewood-medallion-discount-liquor-dallas">Lakewood
						Medallion</a>. DBC picks are available exclusively through
					Lakewood Medallion and
					this partnership continues to blossom. To our hosts at Old Forester, WOWWWW. We are so excited that
					the encore to Dust
					on the Barrel is going to be so unique and delicious. It's going to be one delicious barrel and it
					will make the perfect
					accent to end of the year festivities. And of course, thank you to Scott and the folks at the Gaston
					for proving an
					amazing setting for the evening.</p>

				<p>One last thing that stuck with me. Before signing off, Tyler had a final toast for us. While I didn't
					get a chance to
					write it down or record it, I'll summarize. When the coronavirus is behind us, there's going to be a
					serious reason to
					celebrate and to enjoy how lucky we are. When that day comes, reach up and grab that special, old
					bottle you've been
					holding onto. When this is over, that's going to be reason enough to open that bottle and enjoy with
					family and friends.
					I really liked the timeliness of that toast and what it means. Coming out on the other side of
					something so frightening
					like an unseen pathogen, beating that awful virus and moving into a safer world: that's something
					worth celebrating and
					a day worth remembering.</p>
