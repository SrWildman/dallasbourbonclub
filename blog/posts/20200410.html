				<p>A few weeks ago, we contacted Pecan Lodge about donating to their commissary kitchen to help out of
					work
					families.
					Initially, our plan was to help the relief effort by providing a financial contribution AND some
					physical man power in
					the form of meal prep or food delivery. Unfortunately, as more and more social distancing guidelines
					were put in to
					play, we were only able to provide a financial donation. The leadership group felt that was a little
					too
					anonymous, a
					little too hands off for our charity efforts and what we like to do philanthropically. So, we chose
					to
					table that.</p>

				<p>But we all decided we <b>had to</b> do something to help our community; that we could not just sit
					around in
					our bourbon
					bunkers without doing something to help those around us.</p>

				<p>Hearing about hospitals and their major shortages of Personal Protective Equipment got us thinking.
					Hey!
					We know a
					hospital! So we reached out to our friends at the UT Southwestern NICU, and Yes, they were in
					critical
					need of masks,
					infrared thermometers and face shields.</p>

				<p>So here is where the magic of the DBC comes in. Seeing as how our group was founded on <b>Bourbon.
						Networking. Charity</b>; we
					used our network to get some charity done. The GREAT Daniel Palos has a friend who's company is
					importing/manufacturing
					this type of equipment. After a couple of quick phone calls and some well timed emails, we used DBC
					Foundation funds to
					secure the following donation for the NICU at UT Southwestern:

				<ul>
					<li>500 KN95 Masks</li>
					<li>100 Face Shields</li>
					<li>2 Infrared Thermometers</li>
				</ul>

				Earlier this afternoon, I was able to secure the equipment from a local company in Flower Mound. I then
				dropped off the
				equipment to Daniel for ultimate delivery to the NICU.</p>

				<p>We've done some great things over the past few years, but this one feels really special to me. We
					were
					able to use the
					cash from our dues to support a local business AND go toward helping people in need in an absolutely
					unprecedented time.
					I think what we've done will have some pretty profound effects on families in need. This type of
					protective gear will
					allow dads to get to visit their newborn children, new moms to be near their child and most
					importantly:
					allow nurses
					and doctors to continue to administer life-saving care.</p>

				<p>Even if you weren't directly involved, you had a hand in getting this done. The dues you pay help us
					do
					amazing things
					for the local community. Without each and every single one of you, we aren't able to come together
					and
					make these things
					happen. The Dallas Bourbon Club isn't just me, or Brian, events, or barrel picks: it's a wonderful
					group
					of people who
					give back to our community. So cheers to everything you do...let's raise a glass to helping others
					around Dallas Ft.
					Worth and to each other!</p>
