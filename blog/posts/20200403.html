					<h1>Blind Sampling - Dustin Stone</h1>
					<p>In the spirit of Dixon Dedman's "Bourbon in Box" blind tasting challenge, I decided to get in on
						the fun. I picked a
						secret sample from my stash and gave it to Dustin. The rules were simple: walk me through your
						tasting notes and make a
						guess. It could have been any American Whiskey under the sun, so it was no easy task. Here's
						Dustin with his best guess.</p>
				</header>


				<p>Usually I'm not keen on showing my ignorance when it comes to blind tasting bourbon, but sometimes
					you're handed samples
					you just know are gonna be righteous. Considering the source of this sample is Mr. Pete Schmidt,
					it's a
					safe bet to take
					this risk. Every time I do a blind, I search my memory bank for relatable profiles. While the nose
					is
					very familiar,
					it's like a dream version of what I'm remembering without any of the faults, and not something I
					think
					I've ever owned.</p>

				<p>Initial nose is super sweet and seems around 105-110 proof. Typically I associate this with MGP, and
					I
					was sure it was
					one of their house products: Ambassador, or another well aged MGP. I drifted though, it could also
					be a
					12-14yr Knob
					Creek. Same cotton candy nose, but not quite the same toast. Way too Marshmallow-y for Willett and
					not
					near enough red
					hots, so WFE is out. This is either an MGP product, or something very well hand selected from
					Buffalo
					Trace. In my daily
					drinker category, I often place MGP above BT for sheer reliable drinkability. Not until I get into
					the
					higher end Trace
					bottlings (EHT Barrel Proof, certain picks, and BTAC) does Trace become vastly superior. That's what
					I
					was starting to
					feel from this pour. The signature Trace sharpness; it's there, it's just way more lux, more subtle.
					It's exactly what I
					look for in quality bourbon. And this tasted like a single barrel bourbon, not a rye, not even a
					blend,
					not a finished
					whiskey.</p>

				<p>I poured glasses from distilleries I thought were the most relatable. On the table was a Knob Creek
					14yr
					FWS Pick, EH
					Taylor 129.3 Barrel Proof and MGP's Ambassador 12yr. I do a lot of nosing. It's probably my favorite
					part of bourbon.
					So, I sat these next to the mystery pour, going back to each one in turn for comparison over the
					next
					half hour. The
					Knob Creek devolved quickly into Pickles, and the MGP just sort of dissipated but remained a great
					pour.
					**Sidenote, get
					yourself a bottle of Ambassador, it fits squarely well into the 100-200 category of reliable
					drinkers.</p>

				<p>That left the EHTBP 129.3 for comparison and the closest match so far on the nose. I'm a huge fan of
					the
					129.3, I think
					it's one of the best releases from Trace for 2019, but this mystery is a smooth criminal. If you
					told me
					this was an
					unreleased barrel strength Eagle Rare I would not be surprised. It's a luxury pour from top to
					bottom -
					very ER17 esque,
					but from the recent higher proof releases. Nosing it again is just torture, it's so good. If I am
					way
					wrong on this, I
					hope no one ever reads it but this has one of the best noses I've experienced this year. I would not
					be
					surprised to
					find out this is Eagle Rare 17, or at minimum a really bad ass store pick from the BT family of
					products. I just am not
					convinced its a straight Eagle Rare pick though. It's too special for that. The finish mirrors ER17
					as
					well in how it
					just dissipates quickly, leaving you wanting more, but also not quite as quickly as the 17. Pete,
					did
					you just pour me
					OFC? Holy smokes what a nose! It really is getting better over time, and it's been open now for over
					a
					half hour. Not
					overly oily in the cheeks, which usually I do like, but this has a great balance. I'm sold. This is
					a
					quality pour, and
					I can only hope it's something we see in the group.</p>

				<p>I pour some OFC 1993 for one final comparison. The OFC is a strange beast, it comes across to me
					just
					exactly like ER17
					on the nose, with a very similar but longer lingering finish. This has some similar qualities, but
					enough differences to
					bring me down to earth again. So, what I've got here is somewhat of a cross between an ER17 2018 or
					2019, or a very well
					selected EH Taylor.
					I'll take two please. And if this is our EHT Single Barrel pick, you guys have absolutely knocked it
					out
					of the park.</p>


				Excellent job Dustin! That was one amazing tasting journey. Drum roll please. Here's the big reveal:
