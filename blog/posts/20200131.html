					<h1>Recapping The EH Taylor Barrel Pick Trip</h1>
				</header>
				<div class="image main"><img src="../images/20200605.jpeg" alt="images/pic01.jpg" /></div>

				<p>It was a cold afternoon in Kentucky. Cloudy, windy, and cold. And like most of these trips, they
					start with whiskey.</p>

				<p>Our evening started at the Peal of Germantown. This is a frequent stop for the DBC as they have
					outstanding single
					barrel picks and a great dive bar feel. Yes, great whiskey was enjoyed. They had a half dozen Eagle
					Rare picks, and a
					Weller Full Proof that just blew everyone away. We were joined by Kenny & Ryan of the GREAT Bourbon
					Pursuit Podcast.</p>

				<p>After the opening Salvo of drinks at the Peal, the group made their way to the Pearl's sister
					property, the world famous
					Silver Dollar. As you can see above, the selection at the Silver Dollar is second to none. It's an
					insane whiskey list
					that is completely comprehensive and full of unique single barrels at very reasonable prices. Not to
					mention their
					cocktails, the Bourbon Pursuit boys got us hooked on the Gold Rush cocktail. It's a mix of bourbon,
					honey and lemon and
					it is just outstanding. Can't wait to knock a few back this summer.</p>

				<p>It was an outstanding meal full of laughs, hot whiskey takes (get the Pursuit guys going on Jack
					Daniel's Rye) and story
					swapping. After dinner (and more drinks) we went back to the hotel for cigars and this little tasty
					treat.

					(Never in my life would I think I would have an opportunity to taste Old Rip Van Winkle 25. No other
					words to describe
					except buttery, leathery greatness)</p>

				<p>8 AM wake up calls come pretty early after a long night of bourbon and story swapping, but we were
					all able to make it
					to the bus on time. May I recommend Bruce at Central Kentucky Tours by the way...Feeling totally
					energized and excited,
					we made our way from Louisville to Frankfurt and the gorgeous grounds of the Buffalo Trace
					distillery.</p>

				<p>Despite it being a cold and cloudy day, the grounds of Buffalo Trace are just so pretty and inspiring
					to me. It's a
					beautiful distillery and because of it's status as a National Historical Landmark, the grounds have
					been kept with the
					same look and feel that they would have back in early 1900's. The brick buildings, the tracks for
					barrels, the miles and
					miles of piping...all of it seems like it's been frozen in time from a bygone era. Except it's still
					very much a
					functioning business producing thousands of barrels of whiskey each year and undergoing over a
					billion dollars worth of
					modernization improvements. It's really a neat place and it's hard to describe all of the nuance
					that encapsulates the
					grounds of Buffalo Trace. I'll borrow a phrase from the Great Freddie Johnson that I think does a
					good job capturing the
					spirit of it all: Honor Tradition, Embrace Change.</p>

				<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/20200131_2.png" alt="" /></span>And while that phrase
					may capture the spirit of Buffalo Trace Distillery, Freddie Johnson is the man
					who lives it. I've
					seen the movie NEAT about 100 times, and I've heard Freddie on the Bourbon Pursuit podcast. But
					there is nothing,
					NOTHING, <B>NOTHING</B> that even comes close to going on the man's tours and spending an hour or
					two with
					him. I don't think
					there's anyone more knowledgeable about the history, the whiskey, the people, and the places
					regarding bourbon than him.
					But more than that, he is simply an incredible person and just exudes happiness. He had a kind word
					to say to every
					single person at the Distillery, from gift shop clerk to bottling line manager; Freddie knew their
					name and had a big
					smile. With everything that he does, he inspires joy and radiates positive energy. I had high
					expectations for a Freddie
					Johnson tour of Buffalo Trace and he exceeded them in every single way.</p>

				<p>I know you all want to hear about the barrel selection and we are getting there. I just wanted to
					bring one last thing
					about the tour up. After we took a tour of the mysterious (and amazing) Buffalo Trace vault, Freddie
					pulled us all aside
					for one last story. I'll never forget what he told us:<br>

					<i>"Always remember, it is far better to have the memories that a good bottle creates when you share
						it with friends and
						loved ones than to know the memories never got created because you didn't like the way somebody
						drank their whiskey."</i></p>

				<p>After Freddie's parting words, it was time to select our barrels. Freddie handed us off to Susana,
					our host from a year
					ago, and we were off to the races. Susanna had six barrels available for us to taste and choose
					from: three Colonel
					Taylor's and three Eagle Rare's. As we did last time, there are two ways to taste the barrels: at
					barrel proof and at
					bottling proof.</p>

				<p>Starting with the Taylor, we had three selections to work through: each of them were about nine or
					ten years old and
					clocked in at 135ish proof. As a huge fan of Colonel Taylor, this was a really special experience
					for me. What shocked
					me was 1) Colonel Taylor is a LOT older than I thought it would be and 2) All of the barrels were in
					great shape. A lot
					of times, the barrels get leaky or damaged during their life span, not these, they were all in
					pristine condition. The
					whiskey itself was a tough decision because all three were delicious in their own ways. The first
					barrel had the classic
					Taylor notes of toffee and dark fruit. The second barrel had an outstanding chocolate cherry nose
					and tasted like golden
					raisins and creme brulee. At barrel proof, this whiskey was magical, and the great taste and
					mouthfeel did not
					compromise at 100 proof. But it seems like we saved the best for last. The third barrel had candied
					pecans on the nose
					and tasted like vanilla with an explosion of a finish. This one was my leader in the clubhouse.</p>

				<p>If I could have selected a favorite at barrel proof, it would have been barrel #2. But, ultimately
					that was not an
					option. When the group went to a vote, barrel #1 was immediately voted off the island. The final
					decision came down to a
					blind taste between Barrel A and Barrel B. I thought Barrel A was butterscotch greatness and it got
					my vote, but I was
					in the minority. Barrel B was the winner. And it turned out that our winner was Barrel #2. A
					fantastic choice.</p>


				<p><span class="image right"><img src="../images/20200131_3.png" alt="" /></span>Selecting the Eagle
					Rare barrel was just as delightful. We followed the same formula: one glass at
					barrel proof and one
					glass at bottling proof. Let me tell you that Eagle Rare at barrel proof is NOTHING short of
					beautiful. It's the most
					gorgeous color, and it's got an oily mouthfeel that coats your palate. Buffalo Trace, if you're
					reading this...America
					is ready for barrel proof Eagle Rare!</p>

				<p>Our three barrels were between 10 and 11 years old. My first barrel, Barrel #4, had the most unreal
					mouthfeel that I've
					ever experienced in a whiskey and it had the biggest finish I can remember. Bringing it back down to
					bottle proof, this
					whiskey was nice, light and had those classic Eagle Rare notes of leather and black pepper spice.
					Barrel #5 had an
					interesting taste of bananas and floral notes. Finally, Barrel #6 was nice and easy drinking but a
					little pedestrian
					compared to its brothers. It had the biggest finish of any of the previous barrels which was
					especially impressive given
					it's huge finish stood up at 90 proof. Before the voting began, Barrel #4 was my favorite of that
					bunch.</p>

				<p>When the voting began, it was a quick decision to eliminate Barrel #5. Picking between #4 & #6 was
					not easy. In order to
					help us make a fair assessment, Susanna prepared the two whiskies in a blind taste off. Barrel A had
					a great flavor and
					a superb mouthfeel. Barrel B was just ok to me and it had a corn/grainy aftertaste. When the voting
					began, it was a
					landslide. Barrel A aka Barrel #4 was our winner.</p>


				<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/20200131_4.png" alt="" /></span>With our barrel
					selections completed and the tour done, we thanked our gracious hosts and then packed
					up for our last
					stop: Barton Distillery for a 1792 Full Proof selection.</p>

				<p>While Buffalo Trace shows off its history and illustrious pedigree, Barton prefers to get right down
					to it and focus on
					the whiskey. Once we arrived at the distillery, we hit the ground running. We were ushered to a
					rickhouse where a long
					table was laid out and set up with glasses. Four barrels on the floor of the rickhouse. It was
					FREEZING in there, but it
					was really pretty cool because of the no-frills, all-whiskey vibe that they are going for.</p>

				<p>Our four barrels were lined up and ready. Each of them was roughly 8 years old, barreled at 135 proof
					and bottled at 125
					proof. The first barrel was oaky with lots of vanilla shining through, generally pretty nice. Barrel
					#2 had a strong
					note of honey in the middle but lacked a good finish. The group agreed to eliminate Barrel #3 as it
					just did not stand
					out. The fourth barrel had everything that I love in bourbon: oily mouthfeel and a complex flavor
					The group was pretty
					slight on Barrel 1, 2 and 4 so we had a three way blind set up.</p>

				<p>The three way
					tiebreaker was set up with Left, Right and Center barrels. The left barrel was very
					good, but to me, the
					barrel in the center was really good. The barrel on the right had the most superb mouthfeel. When
					the voting happened,
					it was a runaway winner: the left barrel took it.
