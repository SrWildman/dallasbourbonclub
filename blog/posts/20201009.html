					<h1>Recap: Second Annual DBC Barbecue Challenge</h1>
					<p>Saturday was an absolute blast. We were blessed with amazing weather, a Horned Frogs win (had to
						sneak that one in for
						you, Meinecke) and an even better time. This event is quickly becoming one of the harbingers of
						fall for me: cool air,
						football, being outdoors, and drinking a little bit of whiskey when the sun is out and who
						doesn't love that?</p>

					For those that did not make it, we have a new champion. There was no question of mail in ballots
					here:
					Bill Edwards is
					our new Grand Champion. His brisket dazzled the crowd and he was able to take home the belt and a
					bottle
					of DBC Taylor.
					For those wondering: Bill Edwards did not use a Traeger; just an old fashioned stick burner. Coming
					in
					second place on
					the brisket challenge was Devin Tarver. Devin also used an analog smoker and brought home some
					delicious
					Sagamore
					Manhattan-finished Rye. While there were many fantastic choices for the brisket, these two stood out
					amongst their peers
					and took home some hardware and prize whiskey (which tastes better). On the other side of the
					bracket
					was Josh Snider
					and his pork belly burnt ends. Those were absolutely delicious flavor bombs that took home the
					majority
					of the votes for
					anything goes. Coming in second in the chef's choice division was the great David Parks and his
					pulled
					pork tacos. Well
					done winners! Hope that prize whiskey tastes just as sweet as your victory and the full nights rest
					after being up all
					night.
				</p>

				<p>
					As always, a lot of thank-you's are in order and there are always a lot.
				</p>

				<p>
					Chief among them is our sponsors. A HUGE thank you to Usquaebach Whisky for being the title sponsor
					on
					this event. This
					whisky company contributed all of that delicious brisket you enjoyed. THANK YOU for that! Our
					friends at
					Celestial
					Beerworks were kind enough to drop off a keg of their delicious Digital Relationship DIPA which was
					absolutely enjoyed
					so thank you for that. We original did not plan for any second place awards (or even a second
					place!),
					but thanks to our
					dear friends at Sagamore Spirit and Woodford Reserve, we were will able to expand the prize pool.
					Thank
					you Tim and
					Random for your generous contributions.
				</p>

					I'd like to raise a glass to all of the chefs who put a lot of time and hard work into your
					contributions. The whole
					crowd will agree with me when I say this: there was no bad barbecue that day. It was very tough to
					pick
					out some
					favorites between Marquez' brisket tacos, Palos' beef ribs, Langston's sliders; it was all
					delicious! We
					even had an
					unofficial entry from Mark Kyer that blew the doors off. While there could only be two winners, all
					of
					you did a great
					job and produced some mouth-watering barbecue. Thank you!
				</p>

				<p>
					I was little nervous about having a large-ish crowd during this pandemic. However, watching everyone
					spread out, make
					use of the entire park and using common sense certainly put me at ease. So a huge thank you to
					everyone
					who came and
					maintained a good degree of social distance. Thank you for coming out and having a great time. It
					was
					great to meet a
					lot of you for the first time (digital happy hours don't count) and some of your better halves as
					well.

				<p>
					Finally, the big shout out and all the credit goes to Randall Hoover. THANK YOU for all your work
					coordinating the
					event, helping set up, and providing all of the little things that these events needed. It was
					another
					all timer Randall
					and you were truly integral in pulling it off. Cheers to all of your fine work.
