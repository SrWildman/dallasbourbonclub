					<h1>Review: TX Bourbon Barrel Proof</h1>
					<p>This weeks review comes to us from the great Jeff Underwood, Certified Bourbon Steward. Last
						week, Jeff revisited some
						of TX's line up along with their barrel strength bourbon. For more tasting notes and whiskey
						news & notes, be sure to

				<p>Michael Veach posted on Bourbon Veach super positive reviews a week ago on Firestone & Robertson's
					newest release of
					their TX Bourbon Barrel Proof. Personally, I stood out in the unseasonable ice cold for hours at the
					old F&R distillery
					in December 2016 for the first barrels of TX Bourbon to drop. Got the cool signed bottles, pictures,
					the whole nine. I'd
					been a fan of TX Blended Whiskey for it's uniqueness--love it or leave it, you won't find a vanilla
					creme bomb like it
					anywhere on the planet. In any case, I'd pointed out barrels 1 through 4 in the F&R warehouse on my
					first visit 6 or 7
					years ago--THAT's my bourbon up there--I had some ownership! Ridiculous, but I have a place close to
					my heart for Texas
					bourbon and have had drinks with head distiller, Rob Arnold on numerous occasions. Most of you know
					the story from here.
					That bourbon SUCKED. But, I decided to give it another shot since Veach gave the rare Texas nod, and
					I settled on a side
					by side tasting old and new F&R juice.</p>

				<p><b>Issued:</b> Feb 2020 @ barrel proof 63.7% ABV</p>

				<p><b>Nose:</b> Plenty of raisins, dark cherries, molasses</p>

				<p><b>Taste:</b> honey roasted peanuts, buttery sticky buns, and a tiny hint of cocoa. There's the
					standard
					Texas high minerality
					from our water. I think this hardness often fools drinkers into thinking Texas whiskey is "young".
					But we don't have
					water filtered out over centuries of limestone shelves, and regardless of reverse osmosis technique,
					heavy water gives
					our bourbon it's character.</p>

				<p><b>Finish:</b> Long and somehow syrupy</p>
