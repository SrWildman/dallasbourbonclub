					<h1>Treaty Oak Barrel Selection</h1>
					<p>As you may know, we had a group go down to the Hill Country over the weekend for a barrel
						selection at Treaty Oak.
						Here's Tucker's story of Treaty Oak's hospitality and how the group go to the barrel that they
						did aka "The Cherry Bomb"</p>

				<p>We went out to visit the Treaty Oak ranch for a barrel pick of Ghost Hill Bourbon. This is 100%
					Texas,
					grain to glass,
					whiskey, aged 2 years in the hill country outside Dripping Springs. I highly recommend any member go
					visit as they have
					29 acres of beautiful countryside, tons of room for hanging out (and kid-friendly), an awesome
					cocktails
					lounge, cool
					distillery operations/tours, an awesome BBQ restaurant named Alice’s, and they brew their own beer
					and
					have wine, gin,
					and cocktails so there is something for everyone.</p>

				<p>So after a tour and some amazing BBQ, we got down to the Barrel pick. They brought out 3 barrels at
					barrel proof and the
					same barrels at their standard bottling at 95 proof. The mash build is 57% Corn, 32% Wheat, 11%
					Barley
					with char 3
					barrels. The general taste they discuss for Ghost Hill is Dark Stone Fruit, Soft Oak, Sweet Corn,
					Robust
					Malt, & Mild
					Spicy Finish. We started with barrel proof first.</p>

				<p>Barrel #879 was low proof at 101.6 proof but beautiful amber color. Nice nose of caramel and cinnamon
					with a chewy
					mouthfeel that we picked up graham cracker and apricots. Barrel #890 was a light amber but came off
					hot
					at 123.8 proof.
					Butterscotch and fruit nose with some banana and savory maple/butter taste. Lastly, Barrel #959 was
					similar light amber
					at 120 proof, but the nose was all vanilla and cherry that stayed consistent with the taste with
					sweet
					toffee and cherry
					cola. Overall, the vote was 1, 2, 7.</p>



				<p><b>#1: Barrel 879 - 101.6 proof</b><br>
					Sight: dark amber<br>
					Nose: honey, cinnamon licorice, caramel<br>
					Mouthfeel: Med/light<br>
					Taste: chewy, licorice, graham cracker, apricots<br>
					Finish: quick drop off, alcohol burn, slight corn flavor. Not much</p><br>

				<p><b>#2: Barrel 890 - 123.8 proof</b><br>
					Sight: light amber<br>
					Nose: butterscotch, banana cream pie, fruitcake<br>
					Mouthfeel: Med<br>
					Taste: banana, maple candy, butter toast, savory, spice<br>
					Finish: slight red apple</p><br>

				<p><b>#3: Barrel 959 - 120 proof</b><br>
					Sight: light amber<br>
					Nose: vanilla, herbal, grassy, maraschino cherry<br>
					Mouthfeel: light<br>
					Taste: toffee, cherry cola, vanilla<br>
					Finish: cherry pie</p><br>

				<p>After trying these 3, we did a round at bottle proof of 95 proof to see how they proof down,
					depending
					on how people
					drink them. Barrel #879 stayed similar with a few more chocolate notes. Barrel #890 just died at
					lower
					proof. This
					became a dump glass for everyone. Barrel #959 maintained a lot of character even at lower proof,
					strong
					cherry and
					vanilla remaining while not losing a ton of body. Here it was an overwhelming 1, 0, 9 vote with a
					preference for <b>#959</b>.</p>

				<p>We tried a few new blends from their Red Handed line. You can find the special pick on 13-14 year old
					Dickel juice at
					Total Wine & More. Their older Red Handed blend is much younger, with Virginia and OZ Taylor and
					they
					just released a
					new blend of 2 year Heaven Hill juice.</p>

				<p>And I know we’re a Whiskey group, but their Waterloo Antique Gin is a whiskey drinkers Gin. Aged 2
					full
					years (like
					their whiskey) in new oak, char 3 barrels. Great to replace with any whiskey cocktail and good
					straight.
					Gotta try it.</p>

				<p>They are also releasing a new line called the Daydrinker, that is an 80 proof, 1 year old whiskey
					that
					is a really easy
					drinker and surprisingly good.</p>

				<p>But the highlight is seeing what this brand can do and they are building up their inventory to bring
					a 4
					year,
					Bottled-in-Bond bourbon to market (probably in 2 years) called Old Fitzhugh as they are off Fitzhugh
					road and a great
					play on Old Fitzgerald. They shared some 4 year with me about a year ago, and it is really where
					this
					stuff becomes
					amazing. Can’t wait to see this come out.

				<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/20200313_2.png" alt="" /></span>We ended the night at
					Alice’s for the Steak dinner, and damn, but bourbon and bbq is a great combo.
					They
					had 16oz New
					York strips they served up and they smoke them before searing them and finished with a chimichurri
					topping. Amazing way
					to end the barrel pick.</p>
