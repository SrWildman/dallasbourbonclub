					<h1>Pete's 2020 Bourbon Resolutions</h1>
					<p>The end of the year is always a quiet time for reflection. And having to come up with content
						every Friday certainly
						inspires me to capitalize on that reflection and write it down. So here's what I'm shooting for
						in 2020.</p>
				</header>
				<div class="image main"><img src="../images/20200103.jpg" alt="images/pic01.jpg" /></div>

				<ol>
					<li><b>Less is more</b> - So if I buy less every day Russell's picks, then theoretically I can buy
						more fewer, more sought after
						bottles. Maybe I should try this...</li>
					<li><b>Limit the Facebook groups</b> - As a deskbound worker, I do find myself on Facebook every now
						and then in order to escape
						spreadsheets, quotes, emails, etc. Unfortunately, I am a member of about a dozen or so different
						buy/sell/trade groups.
						I think I need to cut that down to two. Limit the temptation!</li>
					<li><b>I don't have to buy every single Russell's Reserve Single Barrel that I come in contact
							with</b> - This one will be
						really, really tricky. The Turkey is my weakness and these are so good and such a great value.
						But I have more than I
						care to disclose right now...</li>
					<li><b>Open bottles can be stored</b> - While I do make it my mission to get people to open great
						whiskey, I have the tendency
						to open great stuff and then finish it over the course of a month or so. My Four Roses Limited
						is about half way down
						and I got it last month...So, I will aim to continue to open great stuff and share with folks,
						but put it away for
						another great moment in 2020.</li>
					<li><b>I don't need another Glencarin</b> - I really don't need another glencarin, but I want one.
						So I promise that I will only
						buy glencarin glasses from the picks that I participate on. And then the DBC ones, and
						distilleries I visit...</li>
					<li><b>Make more cocktails</b> - I will be the first to admit that I'm a pretty big snob when it
						comes to bourbon straight.
						MAYBE some ice, but that's it. It turns out, I've been missing a great dimension of bourbon that
						I've never really
						touched on. This year I'd love to perfect an Old Fashioned and see how my beloved Wild Turkey
						stands up in one.</li>
					<li><b>Buy more wine for my wife</b> - It's important to keep mama happy and a seemingly endless
						stream of recycled Amazon
						boxes, which are obviously bourbon packages showing up can get a little old. This year, I plan
						to buy her a few more
						Cabs in order to keep the scales even.</li>
					<li><b>Work on the NETWORK part of Bourbon/Network/Charity</b> - I think this is an aspect we can do
						a little bit better on.
						Whether it's me sending out a Meet the Member email on Friday, or something more involved, I
						think we need to do a
						better job showcasing the diverse group of people we have in this club. To be fair, we are
						awesome at bourbon and
						charity, but let's not forget the social aspect of this thing too!</li>
					<li><b>Try more stuff from the new guys</b> - This year, I kind of stuck to the bourbon blue bloods.
						Yes, they are the big guys
						for a reason, they make incredible stuff and they make a lot of it. But, variety is the spice of
						life so in 2020, I plan
						to drink and review</li>
					<li><b>Get Members more involved</b> - One of the big focuses for me this year will be to get the
						rest of you involved in some
						of the cool stuff that we do. This includes your commentary on the emails, event planning, and
						even barrel picks. As
						this organization continues to grow from two dozen guys at Pat Donlin's house to a couple
						hundred people, it's
						imperative that member involvement grows along with it. So for this year, you can expect Brian
						and I to let members (who
						want to be involved) the chance to run point on some of the amazing things we continue to do.
						Those are my top ten bourbon resolutions this year. I think it's a pretty manageable list and
						one that will lead to a
						happy home and a great year.</li>
