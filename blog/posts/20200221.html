					<h1>Don't Get Jaded</h1>
					<p>This quote has been making the rounds on some of the Facebook groups this week. While it's not
						super far
						off base, it's
						worth discussing.</p>

				<div class="image main"><img src="../images/20200221.png" alt="images/pic01.jpg" /></div>

				<p>Maybe I'm just an optimist, but the quote above just brings me down. For those who don't know, Chuck
					Cowdery is a
					whiskey journalist who has been covering bourbon for a long, long time. To his credit, he stuck
					through
					a lot of the
					lean years in the 80's & 90's and helped bring whiskey coverage into the online era. Given the
					proliferation of sourced
					whiskey and some of the slick (and often deceptive) marketing you are seeing out there, this quote
					does
					ring partially
					true.</p>

				<p>But man, the "I'm Smarter than You" attitude and the disdain for bourbon newbies is just terrible
					here.
					We were all new
					to this hobby once, Chuck, and we all made the mistake of getting excited about some esoteric
					sourced
					brand from Total
					Wine only to be disappointed later. Worse yet is the people who have latched onto this quote and
					used it
					to stick their
					noses far up into the air as a way to feel superior to people who have less bourbon knowledge.</p>

				<p>To me, this is what will kill the Bourbon Renaissance. When you have seasoned experts putting down
					new
					(potential)
					connoisseurs. This type of attitude makes bourbon unapproachable to the common man. It creates an
					aura
					of sophistication
					that makes the uninitiated feel anxious about trying something new. It turns the bourbon culture
					into
					the wine culture.
					Bourbon has incredibly humble beginnings and humble origins, turning this into iconoclastic world
					just
					ruins it for
					everyone.</p>

				<p>I always, always, always try to remember that this is just a hobby. It's just something that I like
					to
					enjoy and learn
					more about. It's never a way to benchmark myself against other people. Whiskey is meant to be
					enjoyed
					and to mark a
					celebration. Maybe Freddy Johnson's words still ring true to me, but the reason we buy all this is
					whiskey is to
					ultimately enjoy it with friends and family. The connections and the memories are all far more
					important
					than knowing
					who sourced what from where.</p>
